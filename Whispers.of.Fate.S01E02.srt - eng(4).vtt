[Episode 2]

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.870
[Four years ago, in the peach blossom
forest of Zhoudi Tower]

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.070
A friend who would move heaven and earth

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.920
to kill me.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.120
A friend whom I would search

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.380
to the ends of the earth

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.030
just to find.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.920
Yan,

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.840
for the past six months,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.640
you've been avoiding me.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.670
Actually, that day...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.280
Back then,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.780
under the blossoms stretching for miles,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.820
Senior Brother taught you,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.570
me,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.700
and Zhumei our craft.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.370
It was warm in the spring.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.460
What a beautiful time.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.990
But now,
the flowers still bloom as they did,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.130
yet the people are gone.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.610
After Senior Brother left,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.610
Zhumei vanished without a trace.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.390
In the Zhoudi Tower,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.510
only you and I remain.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.190
Lici,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770
you composed this melody back then.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.650
Today, let's play it once more for him.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.120
What do you say?

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.010
A childhood composition

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.090
could never compare
to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.450
Senior Brother's masterpieces.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.840
But I think

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.480
this melody

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.200
is the best I've ever heard.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.250
Yan…

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480
This is the only melody

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.250
worthy of sending you to your grave.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.840
You used a curse bug on me?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.690
If you hadn't come wounded,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.040
I couldn't have
planted it in you so easily.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.990
Tang Lici,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.300
I wish I could
cut you into a thousand pieces!

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.650
Yan…

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.390
Yan,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.490
it's been four years

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.870
since we parted.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.790
Killing me once wasn't enough for you.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.430
Now,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.190
you're using the Hao family massacre

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.480
to lure me into your trap

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.430
to kill me again.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.650
Since that's the case,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.049
I'll play along.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.330
Let's see if after four years,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.549
you can still manage to kill me.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.150
It was him.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.330
It was Tang Lici.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.680
It was Tang Lici!

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:53.570
It was he

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.440
who told me to say this.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.840
It wasn't me.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.240
Please spare me.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720
Let me go.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.790
There's someone

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.960
so vicious in the jianghu.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.300
How dangerous.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.020
Stop playing dumb.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.860
Why did you kill Lord Hao?

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.550
For money?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.120
Or did he have something

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.750
on you?

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.670
It was because...

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.480
Who's there?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.480
Chi Yun!

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.060
The Blood Ghost Pill?

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.290
Jianghu matters
should be settled in the jianghu.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.350
Either you kill me,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.650
or I kill you.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.430
Masters and servants
can turn on each other for money.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.070
Brothers can betray and kill each other.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.720
In the end,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.250
the heart is the hardest to see through.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.730
Demons are everywhere.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.320
Amitabha.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.910
Right and wrong, good and evil—
they're just a thought apart.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.000
What you can't let go of is obsession.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.650
You're very wise, sir.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.820
Salvation lies in your own hands.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.000
I believe

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.150
you'll eventually reach the other shore.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.910
Yan,

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.290
I'm coming for you.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.170
When it comes to lightness skills,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.870
who can compare to me, Chi Yun,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.630
the Cloud?

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.910
Stop!

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.970
A messenger goose?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.630
You're from the Yanmen Sect?

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.240
I forgot Yanmen had this trick.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720
Had I known,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.630
I'd have raised a hawk myself.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.420
Where did Chi Yun go?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.410
Miss Zhong!

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.390
Miss Zhong!

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.500
Miss Shei?

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.440
Where did this ship come from?

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.070
Miss Shei, why are you here?

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.350
Mr. Tang brought me here.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.180
He said we'd meet you here.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.520
Chi Yun is known as the Cloud.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.700
You won't be able to catch up with him.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.730
Mr. Tang, why are you here?

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.030
And why did Miss Shei come too?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.700
Since we're hunting down the culprit,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.890
it's natural to bring along the victim.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.320
The person you're looking for

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.250
has already gone dozens of li west.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.870
Taking the waterway would be faster.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.530
You already know everything.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.740
That man is incredibly agile.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.250
He's no ordinary fighter.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.510
With the Cloud,

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.390
we won't

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.760
lose him.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.640
And we can

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.930
catch up with them.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.590
I never expected

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.570
this pleasure ship
would have such mechanisms.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.320
Wait.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.480
Mr. Tang, why are you so certain

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.200
that Chi Yun will come this way?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.270
I'm not certain

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.530
about Chi Yun's route.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.030
I'm just certain
where the killer is headed.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.390
You mean…

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.050
you already know
who the killer is?

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.480
Due to my personal affairs,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.070
I have gathered much information.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.510
And coincidentally, one clue

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.290
points right here.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.720
Six months ago,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.000
the Westwind Swordsman, Feng Chuanxiang,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.600
vanished mysteriously
from Liulian Cottage.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.790
Only his footsteps leading into

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.120
the cottage were found.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.620
None leading out.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.240
It is said that

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.910
in Liulian Cottage,

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.630
there were traces
of two people living there.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.570
After Feng Chuanxiang disappeared,

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.090
his mysterious roommate

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.690
vanished too.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.630
And the answer

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.670
lies in this very item.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.960
A goose feather?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.590
Long and resilient;

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.320
lustrous and smooth.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.480
This is no ordinary goose feather.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200
Messenger geese?

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.610
Yanmen's messenger geese?

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.180
100 li east of Yan County

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.300
is the Yanmen Sect.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.440
This river flows from east to west.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.370
If the killer wants
to avoid implicating Yanmen,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.300
he'll head west.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.690
Even if something happens
and he turns east midway,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.290
he'll run right into us.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.440
But...

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.570
that's impossible.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.860
Why do you say that, Miss Zhong?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
What kind of sect is the Yanmen Sect?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.580
The Yanmen Sect began as a bandit clan

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.750
but was granted amnesty
by the former dynasty

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.150
and became

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.270
the military guards of the Yanmen Pass.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.870
Their goose-training skills
are remarkable.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.620
10 years ago,
when the world fell into chaos,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.840
the Sword Sect led many great fighters

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.240
to hunt down Yique Yinyang.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.750
Yanmen provided

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.870
crucial intelligence.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.390
Its leader, Jiang Feiyu,

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.330
has a fiery temper,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.390
but he's extremely

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.960
protective of his own people.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.910
That's why Yanmen disciples

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.570
value loyalty above all else.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.500
There's a saying in the jianghu:

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.310
"Better to offend the King of Hell's men

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.310
than to cross someone from Yanmen."

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.440
It sounds like

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.020
a righteous sect.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.720
It doesn't just sound like it—

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.250
it is a righteous sect.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.860
Yang Shangqing

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.000
was also from a righteous sect.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.870
I found this

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.120
on Yang Shangqing.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.500
To be honest,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.410
my master sent me down the mountain

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.200
not only for the Hao family massacre

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.600
but also for this matter.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.380
These evil pills

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.820
haven't been seen again

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.750
since the death of Yique Yinyang.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.360
What do you think, Mr. Tang?

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.730
I've paid attention

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.730
to the Blood Ghost Pills too.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.560
My leaving the temple

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.390
should tell you what I think.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.520
Then…

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.520
Miss Zhong,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.170
don't worry for now.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.090
Come have some refreshments.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.030
Talk.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.630
Who are you?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.680
Who sent you to kill that guy?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.750
You think staying silent will save you?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.480
Don't…

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.180
Don't push me.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:11.970
Don't push you?

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.000
Then why do you think

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.310
I chased you for over 100 li?

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.880
For fun?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:22.920
Brat,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.500
don't take poison!

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.869
Even an ant fights to stay alive.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.329
Please don't take poison.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:47.780
It's not poison.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.230
What the hell is that?

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.190
This is getting difficult.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.560
Chi Yun, you're not

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.960
as good as you used to be.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.930
I haven't even gone all out yet.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.440
Let's stop here.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.820
He knelt right before you.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.880
The assassin who killed Yang Shangqing

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.550
is actually

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.650
Jiang Cheng.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.920
Miss Zhong, you know him?

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.560
Jiang Cheng is the young master of Yanmen.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.270
He's upright and chivalrous,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.860
a close friend
of the Westwind Swordsman.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.030
They often went to the Huaxi region

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.160
in the Sword King City

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.520
to fight injustice and help the weak.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.330
They're known

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.890
as the Twin Heroes of Huaxi.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.920
Six months ago,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.830
the Westwind Swordsman

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.240
vanished mysteriously at home,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.080
and Young Master Jiang
also went missing.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.610
How did he become like this?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.530
What are you murmuring?

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:46.300
Foxy Tang, what are you murmuring?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.440
I still need to ask him

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.100
why he killed Yang Shangqing.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.310
Is anyone hurt?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200
Drop the act.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.570
I really don't remember anything.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.520
Young Master Jiang.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.350
You…

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.390
You've got the wrong person.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:21.820
I'm…

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.920
I'm not Young Master Jiang.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.310
Over a year ago,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.160
I met you and Mr. Feng

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.710
at the Sword Sect in the Central Plains.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.710
I'm not mistaken.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.280
Now that we know who he is,

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.000
there's no need for questions.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.960
I'll just take him

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.960
to the Yanmen Sect

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.200
and let his people

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.410
explain for him.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.310
Watch out!

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.040
Mr. Tang.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.970
You're injured.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.240
You're injured.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.190
Don't use this hand for now.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.000
You wanted to take your own life

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.450
because you were worried that your actions

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.770
would disgrace Yanmen's name, right?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.040
Foxy Tang,

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.660
you were right.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.140
The so-called Yanmen Sect

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.850
is just a bunch of filth.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.030
Watch your mouth!

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.350
You don't know anything!

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.510
What should I know?

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.430
The Blood Ghost Pills…

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.200
Those evil pills

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.540
have resurfaced in the jianghu.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.990
I thought I had the wrong person,

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.600
but it seems I was right.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.420
You do have the wrong person.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.510
I'm not him.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.070
The poison has spread within you.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.240
Your energy flow is reversed.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.370
You don't have long.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.410
You're not afraid of death,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.510
but you don't want to die now.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.310
You still have unfinished business.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.910
Am I right?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.090
If you don't want to speak

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.190
with all these people here,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.050
we can talk privately elsewhere.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.480
Hey!

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.310
What's so secret

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.110
that it
can't be said in front of us?

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.920
Foxy Tang

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.680
is being so mysterious.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.140
Miss Shei,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.510
how is

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.800
Mr. Tang's injury from earlier?

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.810
Miss Zhong, don't worry.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.680
Once we get back,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.130
I'll apply some more medicine for him,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.130
and he'll be fine.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.990
But, Mr. Chi,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.720
what exactly are

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.980
the Blood Ghost Pills?

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.600
Why does everyone

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.110
go pale

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.510
when they're mentioned?

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.920
They were created by Yique Yinyang,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.110
the former dynasty's Imperial Preceptor
and leader of the Jile Sect,

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.270
to control people.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.680
To control people?

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.610
In the jianghu,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.900
power has always been respected above all.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.640
Who doesn't want

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.370
to excel and rise above others?

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.370
But not everyone

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.000
has the ability and talent.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.390
Greed knows no bounds.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.480
The weak crave power,

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.190
and the strong

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.720
seek shortcuts
to become even stronger.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.130
Those evil pills

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.070
can give your cultivation a huge boost.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.070
So initially,

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.480
the Blood Ghost Pills

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.200
were treated

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.400
like a popular tonic.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.350
But soon after,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.200
people realized

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.260
they'd been duped.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:49.830
Why?

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.080
Anyone who takes those pills

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.910
has to keep taking them for life.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.260
If they stop,
they go mad and die.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.090
So whoever has the Blood Ghost Pills

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.890
controls those people's lives.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.300
Yique Yinyang

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.130
used this very method to seize control

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.520
of half the jianghu.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.130
More than a year ago,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.180
after arguing with my father,

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.100
I went to stay with Chuanxiang.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.150
We lived together on Mount Huaxi,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.550
practicing martial arts

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.640
and fighting for justice.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.500
[Liulian Cottage]

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.970
During that time,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.170
my martial skills improved dramatically.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.030
I thought it was because

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.890
Chuanxiang was training with me.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.170
But little did I know,

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.030
he was secretly taking evil pills

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.680
and mixing them into my food.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.080
After I found out about this,

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.510
I confronted him
about why he spiked my food.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.680
He wouldn't tell me.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.130
He only told me to trust him,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.370
saying he'd help me.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:53.660
Jiang Cheng,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.000
please trust me.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.440
I will help you.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.310
But I didn't want

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.310
that kind of help.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.030
And I didn't need

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.960
to improve my skills

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.200
through such means.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.350
After that,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.840
I refused to take the pills again

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.030
and asked Chuanxiang

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.030
to help me suppress the poison in me.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.440
But that process

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.600
was agonizing.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.930
It was so painful
that just

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.330
thinking about it makes my mind go blank.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.570
Then, six months ago,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.360
Chuanxiang suddenly disappeared,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.640
leaving me alone.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.440
I searched everywhere

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.080
but couldn't find any trace of him.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.860
So I carried
the remaining pills he had bought

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.440
and started

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.700
tracing their source,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.990
which eventually led me

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.200
to Yang Shangqing.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.470
So you feared

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.200
Yang Shangqing

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.530
might expose the truth,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.790
ruining the reputation of Feng Chuanxiang,

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.790
the Westwind Swordsman.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.440
That's why,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.820
even at the risk of being

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.220
chased down by the Cloud,

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.780
you still killed him.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.790
If I'd had

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.790
any other option,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.920
I never would've taken the pill again.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.350
Wind swept across the reed flowers;

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.790
moonlight shone on Mount Huaxi.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.640
We...

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.580
we were such good friends.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.680
Mr. Tang,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.110
I want to find Chuanxiang

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.760
and ask him

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.920
why he did this to me.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.990
We were friends who'd die for each other.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.660
Why do we have to turn against each other?

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:35.910
Very well.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.050
I understand.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.740
You're fortunate.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.640
Today,

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.030
I'm in a good mood.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.010
I'll give you two choices.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.860
Choice one:

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.420
you die now.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:51.980
That way,

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.690
everyone in the jianghu

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.380
will immediately know

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.990
the Jiang family of Yanmen

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.640
colluded with the remnants
of the Jile Sect

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.800
and took evil pills.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.790
Choice two:

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.840
I help you suppress the poison,

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.000
and you'll die in three months.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.660
Then I'll consider

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.170
leaving Yanmen's reputation intact.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.140
What's the condition?

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.380
That pipa player in black—

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.400
you've seen him, right?

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.610
He revealed clues

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.440
that led you to Yang Shangqing,

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.390
didn't he?

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.450
He looks exactly like you.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.770
He killed a lot of people

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.560
and saved a lot of people too.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.720
He's a madman.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.360
Where is he?

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.950
He is nowhere

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.750
yet everywhere.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.700
You won't find him.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.030
He only appears

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.360
when he wants to see you.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.600
Mr. Tang…

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.230
help me.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.560
He can't help you.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.230
Because he can barely protect himself.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:19.070
Report!

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.080
Master Jiang,

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.030
we've spotted the young master

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.360
in the reed marsh ahead.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.270
Foxy Tang!

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.470
Foxy Tang, what's going on?

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.680
Why is he dead?

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.470
Look.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.890
What is that?

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.200
This is…

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.100
A curse bug.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.680
Oh, no.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.710
The Yanmen Sect

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.110
must think we killed him.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.160
Mr. Tang,

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.790
we…

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.790
Foxy Tang,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.120
Yanmen's goose formation

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.850
is quite famous in the jianghu.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.910
Be careful. Don't…

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.750
Kill!

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.080
I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.440
I'm willing to go with you for punishment.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.310
I plead guilty

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.600
and surrender myself.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.160
Master Jiang, please temporarily

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.510
uphold justice for the Sword Sect.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.370
Are you insane?

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.720
What do you mean?

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.120
This guy

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.020
is my accomplice.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:00.850
Master,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.290
I've completed

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:03.120
almost

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.440
all the tasks you gave me.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.070
Now, you are

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.390
the esteemed Master of Fengliu Shop.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:07.710
Tang Lici is just a nobody

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.040
hiding in a ruined temple in Yan County.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.710
You could even

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.310
kill Shao Yanping

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.510
from the Sword Sect

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.370
without breaking a sweat if you wish.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.620
Forgive my ignorance,

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.400
but why don't you

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.060
just kill Tang Lici outright?

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.840
So why go through

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840
all this trouble?

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.220
What's the point

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.680
in killing a monster like him?

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.400
He can't be killed,

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.010
and he has no humanity.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.640
Tang Lici is certainly a monster.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.230
Hua Wuyan, am I right?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.900
Miss Hong.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:08.989
Master,

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.989
you can't let him

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:12.420
die so easily.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.070
If I can kill him once,

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.730
I can kill him a second time.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.850
Hong,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.670
tell me—

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.469
how should I kill him this time?

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:29.969
Naturally,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.440
you should make him feel what you felt,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.940
suffer what you suffered,

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.250
ensure he's condemned by all,

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.580
and completely ruin his name.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.330
In the end,

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.630
let him die miserably

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.840
amid the curses of thousands.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.690
Someone help!

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.630
I'm not his accomplice!

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.990
I'm just a passerby!

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.070
Let me out!

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.220
I'm innocent, I swear!

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.440
Look at the Yanmen Sect.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.890
People are in cages

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.320
while birds are outside.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.190
It's truly a sect

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.650
with no respect for rules.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.650
This really has

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.960
opened my eyes.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.470
Chi Yun,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.720
be quiet.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:45.840
What?

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.050
You have a plan?

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.590
My ears hurt.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.110
You…

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.030
Following you

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.960
has brought me the worst luck ever!

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.200
"I, Tang Lici, killed Jiang Cheng."

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.990
Are you insane?

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.190
If you wanted to come in here,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.550
you could've come alone.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.010
Why did you bring me along?

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.930
I was afraid of being bored alone.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.670
Why are you still carrying that thing?

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.870
This is his curse bug.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.030
Your mortal enemy?

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.070
Besides him,

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.630
who else could have

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.090
used something like this?

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.360
Even if that's true,

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.400
you can't be at the end of your rope.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.160
Why don't you think about

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.930
what his plan might be?

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.920
To frame you?

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.470
He first framed you

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.530
for killing Hao Wenhou and his family

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.090
and then pinned
Jiang Cheng's murder on you.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.380
That's right.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.600
What's right?

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.520
Now, unless the dead come back to life,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.370
no one…

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.070
can prove

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.400
my innocence.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.530
What are they doing?

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.110
That...

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.070
Foxy Tang,

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.470
they're about to boil us alive.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.030
You're too noisy.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.970
I'm starting
to regret bringing you in here.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.050
Stop carving that wood!

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.920
Think of something!

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.530
They'll cook you in a bit

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.990
and eat you in 18 ways.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.700
Neither of us will escape.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:48.860
Think of something?

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.390
Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.150
Then you...

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.320
Because I never planned

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.380
to get out on my own.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.000
Tang Lici,

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.260
you're insane, aren't you?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.470
You truly are insane! I'm certain now.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.800
You are insane!

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.630
You…

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.890
Mr. Jiang, please believe me.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.920
I swear on my honor as a disciple

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.850
of the Sword Sect

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.670
that I'm telling the truth.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.320
Enough!

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.630
Miss Zhong,

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.110
what you're saying is

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.910
simply too shocking to believe.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.160
Cheng…

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.110
he was my elder brother's

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.150
only son.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.670
I practically

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:20.800
watched him grow up.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.260
I know his character well.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.760
How could he possibly

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.620
have taken that kind of evil pill?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.250
The evil pills have begun to spread again.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.550
Mr. Tang was

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.280
actually helping him

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.480
suppress the poison.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.520
Miss Shei can testify to this.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.110
Yes.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.310
Are you done talking?

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.420
I know,

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:43.910
Master Jiang,

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:45.760
after losing your son,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.320
you're very…

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.650
Have you ever lost a son?

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.760
Then what do you know?

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.990
You know nothing!

00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.750
Brother.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.070
Brother.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.870
Master Jiang.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:03.910
Master Jiang!

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.830
Master Jiang.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.000
There must be a reason

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.640
why Jiang Cheng took the pills.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.020
It's up to you
to uncover the truth

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.110
and clear his name.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.720
If you let grief blind you

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.840
to the truth and evidence,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.960
aren't you just playing right into

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.360
the real killer's hands?

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.960
I saw with my own eyes

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.330
Cheng's body explode

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.550
in front of Tang Lici.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.330
Tang Lici has admitted it herself!

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.630
What more proof

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.720
do you need?

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.800
Today, I'll make sure

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.190
that the murderer Tang Lici

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.760
will suffer Yanmen's

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.820
Three Cuts and Six Stabs Punishment.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.840
If it turns out later that I killed

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.760
the wrong man,

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.960
I'll take my own life

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.840
to atone for it.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.330
Light the fire!

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.630
If they

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.280
really put me on that burning stake,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.720
I'll fight my way out of here.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.630
Chi Yun,

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.250
a lot of times,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.780
only when you hit rock bottom

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.440
does a way out finally appear.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.690
What's happening?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.700
Such a nice fragrance.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.440
The scent of magnolia.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:37.630
No,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.510
not flowers.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.500
It's sword energy.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:48.660
Only one person
has this kind of sword energy.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.880
Who?

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.630
The one

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.180
who vanished long ago—

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.920
the Westwind Swordsman,

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.730
Feng Chuanxiang.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.850
Mr. Feng?

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.190
I heard

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.190
you'd gone missing,

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.450
and I found it strange.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.570
With such exceptional skills,

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.360
how could you

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.490
have just vanished?

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.720
I did encounter some problems.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.320
Are you here today

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.470
to see Cheng?

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.450
Cheng has been killed.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.850
I know.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.550
Then why did you

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.750
extinguish the fire?

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.360
I was going to

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360
make the murderer

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.390
suffer the Three Cuts
and Six Stabs Punishment

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.670
before burning him to ashes

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.760
to honor Cheng's spirit in heaven.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.670
Understand?

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.150
I can say with certainty,

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.990
Master Jiang,

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.110
that Cheng's death
is part of

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.440
something much bigger.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:49.940
Cheng and I were close friends.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.200
I'd never
deceive you

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.730
about something like this.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.170
You know something?

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.840
There is indeed something off.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840
If you're willing

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160
to trust me,

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.520
would you allow me

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.880
to investigate it?

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.840
Brother,

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.610
isn't that Cheng's…

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:32.770
Master Jiang,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.040
do you believe me now?

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.200
What do you want?

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.360
I want…

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:45.430
Mr. Tang.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.360
I need

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.990
to think it over carefully.
