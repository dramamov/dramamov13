WEBVTT

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.360
First day and you’re already famous,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.660
so fitting for Ice.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.440
You must’ve watched all the porn films I starred in, right?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.170
What do you want, huh?

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.290
Huh?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.070
Stop!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.930
Your roommate is super handsome, super generous.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.120
What are you doing here?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.400
This is the roommate you told me about?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900
Do you really have that big a problem

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.680
with leaving me alone?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.560
But I never planned on leaving your life.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040
I’m sorry, I know it’s not enough,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.100
but still, I’m sorry.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.870
Ice.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.530
So Ice, you need to help me with the casting tape.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.440
Third person, please.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.080
That was wonderful!

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.230
I liked it.That's it.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.000
Saint... You..

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.650
Why did you cast for this film?

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.460
Hey.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.280
Are you a child?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.350
You're the child.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.460
You keep following me around.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.580
Why are you so sure that I'm following you?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.620
Then tell me the reason why

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.320
you casted for this role.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.190
Or did you hear my conversation with Sea?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.160
I just saw the casting announcement,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.520
so I wanted to audition.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.930
It’s not like the role specified that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.440
I was forbidden to try out.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.460
Hey, give it to me.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.039
Come on, Saint, give it!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.600
Saint, are you inside?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.759
I’ve got good news!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.280
I’m here.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.960
I was just changing, what’s up?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.900
Yes! The latest confirmation is... TQB

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.280
chose you to play Kit!

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.440
Looks like I’ll be your co-star after all.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.320
You’d better turn Cookie down.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.590
Why should I do what you tell me to?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.400
Let me go!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.700
Did it go through?

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.200
Saint!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.880
Ice!

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.310
Saint!

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.680
Are you ok?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.829
Do you need help in there?

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:47.670
Saint!

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.540
Did you hear a phone ringing just now?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.910
Yeah, I think so.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.640
Don’t tell them that you’re in here with me.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.800
Why? What are you scared of?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.420
I just don’t want people to know we’re together.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.730
So… will you act with me or not?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660
No answer like that..

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.830
Did something bad happen?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.680
Should we go in?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.730
Yeah.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.440
Alright, fine. I’ll act with you.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.440
Get up.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.350
Sorry for replying late.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.600
I was naked.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.490
Oh…

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.550
Oh, okay.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.860
And Ice is…

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.090
Not in here.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.090
I’m alone.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.340
Oh, okay.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.300
So he’s not here, right?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.390
Did you tell Saint yet?

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.650
Yes, I did.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.070
Alright then, let’s get ready to go to the party.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.220
But we still haven’t found Ice.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.320
What about the dressing room?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.240
We called, and Ice’s phone rang from inside,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.880
but Saint said he wasn’t there.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.890
I forgot, he’s probably out smoking again.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.220
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.640
If Saint and Ice were in the same room,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.540
it’d be too shippable, right? Exactly!

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.000
Come on.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.590
Alright, come on, let’s go eat.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.230
Get ready, we’ll follow later.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.440
I ship them so much! Are they together?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.520
It’s true

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.810
Sea.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.920
Hmm?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.740
Is something wrong?

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.950
Can't we change my co-star?

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.500
Why?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.450
I already confirmed Saint with the investors.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.780
Is something wrong?

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.750
They really like him, you know.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.909
Well, maybe if we switch,

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.190
we’ll get someone better.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.810
Ice!

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.180
How can you say that changing

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.330
would make things better?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.230
Then point out who’s better!

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.420
Is there anyone who actually fits the role?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.350
Well, Saint is...

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.960
What?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.710
He’s handsome, tall, acts well,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.210
understands the character,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.950
and delivers emotions perfectly.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.460
You don’t need to look for anyone else.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460
I’m not changing him.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.300
Sea.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.170
No.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.850
I’m so sick of his face.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.350
I go home, he’s there.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.290
I’m doing this for you, you know.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.000
For me?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.420
Yeah.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.120
I’m not changing.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.760
Whatever.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.690
Let’s go eat. Come on.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.960
Go, go.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.520
Go.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.720
You’re really not changing?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000
Nope! Not changing!

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.040
If everyone’s here, then…

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.040
Cheers!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.390
Whoo!

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.710
Let me get the soup for you.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.710
This one.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.030
Thanks.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.500
Cookie, pass me your bowl, please.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.930
Mala’s fine.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.950
Thanks you.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.460
If you’re serving, then serve properly!

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.540
Don’t act suspicious, hurry up.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.080
Yum, clams!

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.490
Why did you get clams?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.000
Oh, you two!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You’re such a perfect match.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.270
Your chemistry is amazing!

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.560
I can’t wait to start filming.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.960
Our chemistry is so not there.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.560
What? If you two didn’t have chemistry,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.130
you wouldn’t have connected

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.390
so well during the audition.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.300
Right, Sea?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.700
Sure.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.610
You like spicy food, right?

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.960
Yeah, but I’m not taking anything from you.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.900
Hello everyone! Do you know who I am?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.350
I’m Fortune-teller Cookie~

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.510
Today I’ll be reading everyone’s fortune!

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:56.800
And my first daily reading client is…

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.060
Ice!

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.380
Give me your hand.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.000
Come on, hurry up.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.970
Hmm,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.560
your career line says

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.610
you’ve worked hard since young.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.050
Family line isn’t great,

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:32.080
had a family but separated.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.000
Next… hmm, this one looks like...

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.690
Why doesn't this look like a hand print?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.910
It’s a scar.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.730
Oh, what happened?

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.620
Don’t meddle in his business.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.130
Sorry.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.440
Can I read one more line?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.650
Love line. Love, love! Give me your hand.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:06.170
Your love life has had obstacles.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.060
People come and go…

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:20.360
but in the end, they meet again.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.030
Ah!

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.330
Cookie!

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.080
Mhm.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.660
She’s probably dead now.
Mhm.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.800
Sea, I’m stepping out for a smoke.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.700
Okay.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.060
I’ll go to the bathroom too.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.300
Smoke too much and you’ll get cancer.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.630
Ice, that scar on your hand.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.680
What happened?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.540
Ice.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.160
Sometimes I wonder…

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.030
why do I have to keep running into you?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.810
At home, you’re there.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.300
At school, you’re there.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.750
And now I have to act with you too.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.730
I’m exhausted these past few days.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.870
If my life can’t avoid you,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.870
can you at least keep your distance from me?

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.600
Stop bothering me.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.770
Just as a colleague, okay?

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.890
Please?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.260
Go.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.200
Cookie?

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.290
Nah. Let’s go home.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.750
Can’t eat anymore.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.730
Katy’s done too.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.930
We’ve finished everything. Yeah, yeah.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.880
Let’s go.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.270
Get home safe.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.420
Get home safely. Ok.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.700
Please look after her.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.000
Hello.
Hi.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.590
I'm taking her home now Saint.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.850
Please look after her, Katy.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.240
See you.
Bye.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.640
Is there something wrong?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.710
Hey, Sea, have you known Ice for a long time?

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.250
Yeah.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.980
We’ve known each other since we were kids.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.060
He used to live near my house.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.920
Then… can I ask you something?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.920
Sure.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.680
What exactly happened to Ice last year?

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.830
Can you return this diary to Ice for me?

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.830
He dropped it.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.030
I know it’s rude to read someone else’s diary,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.840
but I think there are things you should know.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.360
I’m heading off.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.760
Today started out bad from the very morning.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.340
But at least I met one kind person.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.410
Hello?

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.440
What are you doing?

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.390
I working to pay off your debt, of course.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.690
And where’s the money for today?

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.680
Why haven’t you sent it yet?

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.580
Even if I send it,

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.080
you’ll just spend it on booze anyway.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.110
You brat! No matter what,

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.920
you’re my son and that means

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.020
you have a duty to take care of your father.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.750
Otherwise, how can you even call yourself my son?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.250
Have you ever asked yourself?

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.250
if you’ve ever done your duty as a father?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.640
You didn’t even give birth to me

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.810
and we’re drowning in debt,

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.220
and you still drink.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.000
Fine, I’m ungrateful.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.390
But I’m not sending you anything. That’s final.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.560
Hey! Ice!

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.910
Ice!

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.790
Wait!

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.300
Shit, shit!

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.790
Damn it, why did it break now?

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.660
How do I fix this…

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.710
Here.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400
Why are you giving this to me?

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.360
Just take it.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.960
You’ve got to get back to work, right?

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:38.630
Hello.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.050
Hello.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:45.870
You’re Ice, the tutor Mr. Khom contacted, right?

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.640
Yes, that’s me.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.000
Please, come inside.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.480
Mr. Khom, the tutor you hired has arrived.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.860
Come in.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.240
Hello.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.260
Hmm.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.220
Your skills are quite impressive.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.460
A gold medalist in the Math Olympiad,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.460
and always top of your class every year.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.120
I can hardly believe

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.560
that someone from your background

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.640
could achieve this much.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.930
Anyway, I’ll leave my son’s tutoring in your hands.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.390
I want him to get into Business Administration.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.720
Don’t worry about payment.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.500
I'll pay you well.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.910
Got it.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.370
I’ll do my best.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.870
Hmm.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.560
Saint!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.150
Perfect timing, come here.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.610
This is your tutor, his name’s Ice.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.610
He’ll be teaching you Math for Grade 12.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.180
And this is my son, Saint, your student.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.090
Nice to meet you, Ice. Please take care of me.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.030
All done.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.790
Everything’s correct, good job.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.790
10 out of 10.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.330
You must’ve checked it wrong.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.250
How can I get all of them right?

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:59.380
Look closely, this one has swapped signs.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.650
So that means you know how to do it, right?

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.350
How could I?

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.350
I was just guessing.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.210
Just guessing but got it all correct.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.620
So are you gonna tell me nicely,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.600
or do I have to tell your dad?

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.490
Fine.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.590
I don’t actually want to study Business.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.310
Then why don’t you tell him that?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.280
You have no idea how strict my dad is.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.000
So, are you gonna tell him or not?

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.670
Please, Ice.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.130
Help me out.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.260
Think of it as helping each other.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.710
I really don’t want to study Business.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160
Help me.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.210
Alright, fine.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.330
Consider it payback that you lent me your shoes.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.740
Ice, you’re so nice!

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.120
So, what do you really want to study?

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.640
Communication Arts.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
That’s totally different.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.800
I’ve never felt important to anyone before.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.090
But today, somehow, I feel like I matter.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.000
By the way, I’ve never asked you

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.380
why you want to study this major.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.660
It’s probably because when I was little,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.580
I only had one photo of my family.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.980
So I guess I wanted to be a photographer.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.130
And in the future,

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.920
if I have someone I love or a family,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.770
I’d want to take lots of pictures of them.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.690
That’s really touching.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.110
What about you, Ice?

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.920
You’ve been tutoring me all this time,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.960
but I don’t even know what major you want.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.070
I want to study Communication Arts.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.360
Really?

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.670
Why?

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.930
I used to want to be an actor.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.390
But my face looked funny on camera,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.430
so I gave up.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.840
No way, your face doesn't look funny at all.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.960
Hey, Ice, can I ask you something?

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.740
Based on your assessment, do you think

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.270
I can take the university equivalency test this year?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.280
Do you think I still have enough time to get ready?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.440
I think you can, but it’ll be tough.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.570
You’ll need a lot of test scores.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.520
Then I’ll do it, I’ll work hard

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.180
because I want to study Communication Arts with you.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.640
What?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.220
Well, we’re close now,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.760
and we share the same dream.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.840
We could go to university together.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.690
I’d be the photographer, you’d be the actor.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.600
Why do you like red sunflowers?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.840
Probably because they stood out the first day

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.190
I saw them.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.960
They looked a little different.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.000
Kind of like you.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.420
Hey, are you teasing me?

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.430
No, I didn’t mean it like that.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.590
I meant

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.120
you stood out to me from the very first day.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.990
Ice, let’s keep taking more photos.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.120
This time, smile big, okay?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.900
Pretend you’re a sunflower

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.530
facing the sun.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.340
Come on.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.160
What are you two doing?!

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.460
Tell me, are you still working as my son’s tutor,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.170
Mr. Ice?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.510
Sir, it’s almost time for your meeting.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.630
After this course, don’t come to tutor Saint again.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.060
Hello.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.620
Please leave, Mr.Ice.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.130
Why?

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.800
The payment’s already been transferred, right?

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.890
Yes.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.040
Then why did you come back?

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.230
Oh, did you come to see Saint?

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.600
Yes, sir.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.190
He’s inside.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.790
Can I go see him?

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.080
I just wanted to congratulate him for passing the exam.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.280
It’s probably not a good idea

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.850
to disturb Saint and his girlfriend right now.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.980
What? Didn’t he tell you?

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.980
That he already has a girlfriend?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.860
When he enrolled in Communication Arts, he told me

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.860
he wanted to study the same major as his girlfriend.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.820
Thanks for helping him pass the exam.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.130
But I don’t think there’s any reason

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.870
for Saint to see you anymore.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.880
You can go now.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.210
The red sunflower he once said was like me,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.600
its English name is Midnight Sunflower.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.640
And I should’ve known long ago

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.760
that this kind of sunflower

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.000
was never meant to exist beside the sun.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.340
Oh, hello there, freshman.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.340
Hello.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.480
Aren’t you happy? You passed the exam!

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:39.690
You okay? You can talk to me, you know.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.270
I’m fine, professor.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.860
Hey, we’ll be together for four years.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.560
I’m your acting-for-film professor.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.060
Most students come talk to me

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.660
when something’s bothering them.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.000
If you’re upset, you can tell me. It’s okay.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.030
It’s just some stupid stuff in my life, professor.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.600
Someone told me

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.720
they’d study Communication Arts with me.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.200
But in the end, it all just talk.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.930
It turns out they already had a lover.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.150
Ah, I see.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.730
I was wondering what was wrong.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.230
So that’s why you’re sad, huh?

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.450
Love is complicated like that.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.980
Don’t stress too much.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.120
You know, when I was your age,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.480
I got heartbroken almost every day.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.050
What? You did, professor?

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.250
Of course,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.570
that’s why I’m telling you not to worry too much.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:46.210
If you ever need to talk, come to me anytime.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.210
I’m rooting for you.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.590
Thank you, professor.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.310
Do you feel a bit better now?

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.870
Ah, I just happened to have this with me.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.870
Drink some water, it’ll refresh you.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.340
Thank you.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.010
Zoom.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640
It's your turn now.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.000
That day

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.150
I felt like everything came crashing down again.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.680
I threw up more than ten times after waking up.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.740
I was both furious and disgusted

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.000
at what Professor Mint did to me.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.900
Hey! What the hell did you do to me last night?

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.390
What are you even talking about?

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.290
What the hell did you do to me?!

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.000
Last night you tricked me, you drugged me.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.620
Stop!

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.800
You bastard.
Ahhh!

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.390
You asshole.
Stop!

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.720
Professor, are you his wife?

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.710
Do you even know what your husband did to me?

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.310
Ugh.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.990
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.440
You’re just a freshman.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.550
How dare you scream at a professor like this?

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.390
Someone, please get this kid out of here.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.480
You’re the one who should stay out of this.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.260
You.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.510
Stop pretending you don’t know what’s going on already.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.420
Ow!

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.220
Fah!

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.440
Professor!

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.730
Fah!

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.420
Ugh.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.420
Fah!

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.120
Fah!

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.400
Ugh.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.580
Fah!

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.440
Ugh. Fah!

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.690
Everywhere you go, it’s trouble after trouble.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.160
As the university president,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.330
the only thing I can tell you is

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.780
think carefully about whether

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.240
you’re even fit to be a student here.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.190
Saint had been gone from my life

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.830
for three weeks already,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.719
even though I kept trying to call him.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.590
After that incident, I decided to drop out.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.929
I thought maybe this messed-up, broken life

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.929
was the only thing that really suited me.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:30.880
Hey!

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.980
So have you found the money

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.010
to pay off your dad’s debt yet?

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.409
Just because your dad is dead

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.500
doesn’t mean the debt disappeared, you know.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.000
I… I…

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.929
Can I go work more to earn money?

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.290
Then I’ll bring it to you as soon as I can, please?

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.200
Do you even know how much you owe now?

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.000
Even if you sold both your kidneys

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.200
it wouldn’t be enough.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.840
Unless you sell your whole body,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.730
then maybe you could pay it off.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.050
Please.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.320
Selling your whole body sounds interesting though.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.400
I heard your clip just leaked too.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.760
After that day, they forced me to shoot porn.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.590
I thought dying from this world was the best way out.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.790
Hello.
Hello.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.220
What would you like today?

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.350
The usual, one glass please. Alright.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.760
Thank you.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.530
All done.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.770
Sea, right?

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.270
Never thought I’d bump into you here.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.090
May I sit with you?

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.670
Miss Lanee, are you here alone?

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.460
I’m a regular here, come so often it’s familiar now.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.420
You can just call me Lanee, Sea.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.670
Better not.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.730
I’m just an ordinary third-year student too, you know.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.380
I don’t carry

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.670
the title “daughter of TQB” around all the time.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.150
Alright then, Lanee it is.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.320
Do you know, Sea,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.380
the film project you’re working on is so good.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.800
I was just talking to my mom about it.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.280
If this project comes out,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.790
people will definitely pay attention on a wide scale.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.220
Because it’s about sex, the economy,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.880
and society all together.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.880
Plus…

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.140
Sea, are you okay?

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.470
Usually, when talking about filmmaking,

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.470
your eyes light up.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.870
How do you know I’m like that?

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.160
I’ve been watching you all along.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.330
I’ve seen you since you won your first film award.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.720
And the winner of the Wildtype Film Festival is

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.420
Thithara Phuthongkham! A round of applause, please!

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.020
Woooh!

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.400
I’m so happy and I hope that our film

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.160
can bring some attention to the problems

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.910
of the disabled in society.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.410
Woooh!

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.450
So this year, who should

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.040
we send to give advice to the freshmen?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.250
On the acting side it’s Lanee.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.950
Then on the film side…

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:41.850
Should it be Sea, third-year?

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.490
She’s smart, talented,

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.980
and super cool too.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.530
Right?
What do you think?

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:56.720
Believe me, Sea, you’re not the only one who knows me.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.780
So, are you stressed about something?

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.070
If you’re stressed, you can talk to me.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:07.290
I promise I’ll listen without judging.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.680
Have you ever been lied to?

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.610
All the time, but I take it case by case.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.580
Because sometimes people who lie

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.110
might have their reasons.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:29.110
And what if a woman lied to you just

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.380
because she saw you as someone to fool around with,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.270
and in the end ran back to her boyfriend anyway?

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.890
In that case, you have every right to be mad.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.670
I’ll even be mad with you.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.510
How about that?

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.100
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t judge?

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.000
Never thought you’d be this talkative.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.500
I only talk this much with people I want to talk to.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.480
Cheers.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.230
So, when you’re feeling down,

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.640
do you always come here and drink alone like this?

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.640
Usually, I prefer somewhere quieter than this.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.080
Like where?

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.310
The beach, maybe.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.810
The beach?

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.660
Then why don’t we go find a mermaid together?

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.570
It’s only an hour away from here.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.850
And how are we getting there, Ms.Lanee?

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.330
You know you can’t drive drunk, right?

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.330
Don’t worry.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.790
I’ll have my driver take us.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.760
Right, right.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.100
I forgot you’re the daughter of the TQB chairman.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.100
Thanks for bringing me here.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.350
It might sound over the top, but it's my pleasure.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.970
Sorry.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.000
It’s okay.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.890
So why do you like the sea?

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.700
Don’t tell me it’s just because your name’s Sea.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.290
Not at all.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:59.160
I like the sea because it makes me feel calm.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.350
I feel peaceful when I sit and listen to the waves.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.350
That’s such a cool line.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.180
Actually, I like the sea too.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.290
Hmm? Why’s that?

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.280
If it were before, I’d say it’s because I liked mermaids.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.130
That’s why you’ve got that mermaid keychain, right?

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.600
Don’t laugh.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.230
I’m not.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.350
It’s cute. Tell me more.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.310
Well, since mermaids are always with the sea,

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.890
I guess I started liking the sea more too.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.600
No poetic reason like you, Miss Director.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.540
It’s not that poetic.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.760
But honestly, the mermaid keychain suits you.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.760
Don’t you think?

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.990
You’re giving this to me?

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.030
Thanks.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.940
You know, I think I just found

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.800
another reason to love the sea even more.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.490
And what’s that?

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.280
Because it’s beautiful.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.220
The closer I look, the more I want to stay.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.510
Hey, Katy.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.510
Ice!

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.360
Sea told me to bring you the script.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.140
What a coincidence you live in the same dorm.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.270
So Sea asked me to hand this to you.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.800
Please make sure to study your character.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:32.830
Got it.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.550
By the way, what’s your room number again?

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.140
It's 803.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.510
803?

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.120
Something wrong?

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.510
Oh my god, 803!

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.670
That’s the same number on Saint’s envelope!

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.700
Don’t tell me..

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.310
you two live together?

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.700
Uh, yeah.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.740
Well, well!

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.280
You guys must be close then.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.130
Nosy!!

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.950
Ever heard of privacy?

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.580
You know? Privacy?

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.770
Sorry! Got too into this series.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.230
Go on, go on, don’t mind me!

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.900
Anyway, I’ll bring the script to Saint too.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.920
Alright then, don’t forget to do your homework.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.870
See you later, Katy.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.870
Bye!

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:45.180
I knew it, I'm totally going to tell Cookie.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.000
Still not done being nosy, huh?

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:55.410
Sorry, talking to my doll again! Oh.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.580
Sea told me to bring you the script.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.140
And don’t forget to analyze your character.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.440
So, are we still reading together?

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.820
Are you done yet?

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:06.620
Then let’s find the character’s drive next.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.220
What’s that?

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.170
You want to act and don’t even know that?

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.650
Drive means the inner motivation of the character,

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:22.850
what pushes them to act or decide something.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.980
Like, if someone grows up in a strict household,

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.680
they’ll crave freedom,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.630
so when they finally get the chance to be free

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.320
what do you think they’ll do?

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.360
Probably grab that freedom as fast as they can.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:51.880
Then what do you think the character Kit wants?

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:02.090
Maybe he just wants Seen to be happy again.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:18.280
And what about Seen?

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.300
He just wants peace.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.260
Saint, can I ask you something real?

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.220
Why did you agree to act in this film?

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.890
And don’t say coincidence, I won’t believe you.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.340
What if I told you

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:53.510
I wanted to make things right this time?

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.130
What do you mean?

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.140
Yes, Dad.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.950
What's going on at your University?

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:18.110
I heard that there's alot of problems?

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.230
Nothing serious, just students pulling pranks.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.780
Pranks? Who got pranked?

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.190
You don’t need to worry, Dad.

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.080
No one got hurt.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.920
If something serious happens,

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.440
I’ll let you know.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.640
If you say there’s nothing, then fine.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.200
How’s your study going?

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.960
Good, the new term just started.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.680
Hope you’ll keep that straight-A record.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.270
I let you take an easy major,

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.030
so I expect first-class honors when you graduate.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:52.260
Yes, Dad.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.990
One more thing, I heard that

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:57.720
tutor boy came back to school.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.560
I hope you’re not getting

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.560
involved with him again, are you?

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:07.730
Well?

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.730
Promise me.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.920
Yes.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.650
I won’t get involved with him again.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:19.930
Let’s hope you mean it.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.010
Hey.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.950
We’re not analyzing the characters anymore?

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:33.640
No need.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.710
You’re already such a good actor.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.860
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.790
Saint, sometimes I really wonder

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.580
what’s going on in your head.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.860
When you talk to me, you say one thing.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.750
With your friends, another.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.780
And with your dad, something else entirely.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.690
Don’t you get tired?

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:52.220
Always changing your story?

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.980
You said you wanted to make things right,

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.390
but you see that getting water dumped on

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.050
and having my photos spread as just a prank.

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:04.960
I...

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.510
Don’t.

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.720
In the end,

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.460
you’re just the kind of person

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.750
who stands by and watches.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.420
Go back to your dad.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.710
Professor about that question you gave earlier.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.710
I still don’t quite get it.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:48.470
Well, if you’d like to understand it better,

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.600
you can come to my office.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.050
I’ll tutor you all night.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.360
It's only the beginning of the semester

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.090
and you're already looking for new students?!

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.730
He wouldn’t pick a fight for no reason, Ice!

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.400
there must’ve been something between them before.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.400
If the issue with Professor Mint comes to light,

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.700
won't anyone else become Professor Mint's victim?

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.950
I don't want to live like you.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:29.600
I don't want to have a leaked video.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.590
No matter what you've been through, I'll always be by your side.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.840
Do you really mean that, Saint?

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.110
Okay, I promise.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.950
I'm sorry that

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.320
I could never help you.
