=Light Beyond the Reed=

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 16=

00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:55.511
You have only been married
for more than a year

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:56.980
and you're already so close.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:58.820
Do you know her from the past?

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.580
No. Not at all.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.940
I've never seen her before.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.980
Are you sure?

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:06.380
Which high school are you from?

00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:08.340
I'm from the No. 7 High School.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.740
Have some tea.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.660
Nianwen.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.700
How did your sister
and your brother-in-law meet?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.540
Blind date.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.820
I heard Sibei didn't meet anyone
during the blind date

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.220
and met Nan.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.977
They fell for each other
after they met and spoke to each other.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.340
My father was upset about it

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:32.980
because Nan
had a low level of education.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.540
However, Sibei wanted him.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
Love at first sight.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.900
That's probably it.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.540
Sibei

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.060
met too many bad men back then.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.300
My mother scolded her every day.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.380
She was so afraid.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.260
Qin Nan is also from Nancheng, right?

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:53.220
Which high school did he graduate from?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.860
I don't know about that.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.000
He didn't mention it before.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.940
Captain Zhang.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.220
Did you come here today

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.827
because you have updates
about Sibei's case?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.660
Nianwen,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.260
Sibei has given up.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.220
What are you obsessing about?

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.740
I don't know.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.580
I...

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:35.780
I can't overcome this.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.740
Whenever I close my eyes,
this is all I can see.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.380
This incident ruined Sibei,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.860
my mother,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.100
and Chuchu.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.220
Everything around me
has been affected because of this.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.220
If Sibei cannot have justice,

00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:53.300
I will never get over this.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.820
Nianwen,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.740
there's a new clue

00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:02.500
in Sibei's case.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.140
What is it?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.380
If what Chuchu said back then was true,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.620
what Sibei told us

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.340
might not be true.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.220
Captain Zhang,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.740
what do you mean?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.540
Are you saying that Sibei lied?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.860
Perhaps Sibei

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.020
remembered wrongly?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.150
Previously,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.140
I considered this possibility.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.860
If Sibei

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.220
had taken psychiatric drugs like this,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.140
she might have had a vague memory

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.340
or even lost her memory.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.780
Objectively speaking,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.820
Meng Xin was right.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.500
With the amount she drank,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.740
it was

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.460
almost impossible

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.480
for her to lose her memory.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.340
However, Sibei

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.300
did not do a blood test

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.355
and missed the best window
for evidence collection.

00:04:56.822 --> 00:04:58.220
Recently, we've been investigating

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.940
the illegal trade of controlled drugs
in Nancheng.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.900
We just raided one of their hideouts.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.260
We will verify with the buyers
that the drug dealer told us

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.900
one-by-one.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.740
If one of them

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.900
mentions Fan Jiancheng,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.340
that means

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.133
he had the intention
to commit the crime.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.820
Captain Zhang,
what do you need me to do now?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.340
Find Chuchu.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.340
Find her?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.220
Ask her to stand up

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.533
and admit she gave false testimony
during the first trial.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.140
It's no use, Captain Zhang.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.220
She won't stand up for it.

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:40.600
If she could,
she would've done it already.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.180
Are you that sure?

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.860
Let me tell you, Nianwen.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.660
For many people,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.860
when they are
at this crucial point in life,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.500
they would feel like standing on

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.540
a steel wire

00:05:54.022 --> 00:05:55.955
with kindness on one side
and evil on the other.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.620
Which way

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.340
she falls

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.260
depends on how the world pushes her.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.220
It depends on you.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.900
How do you want to push her?

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.220
Chuchu,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.260
lunch is ready.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.900
Come out and eat.

00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:32.540
You've been shutting yourself inside
for a month.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.100
Come out and get some fresh air.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.940
You can't go on like this.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.940
I'm very worried about you.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.060
Hello, Master.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.060
Lin Feng.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.860
Call Nancheng No. 2 High School.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.740
Help me investigate

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.020
if there's a student
called Qin Nan in 2006.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.380
All right.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.620
Oh, I need a day off this afternoon.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.260
What are you doing?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.220
Qin Nan called me.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.020
He said something felt off

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.933
about Ye Sibei.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:00.900
She's going to take a bus
to Guangzhou alone.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.180
Qin Nan is very worried.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.740
He wanted me to accompany her.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.100
Sure. Go ahead.

00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:06.466
Help me with the investigation

00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:07.900
at Nancheng No.2 High School
immediately.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.740
Sure.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.020
Chuchu.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.060
Nianwen is here to see you.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.500
Why are you here?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.340
Come in.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.900
How's Mrs. Ye doing?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.300
She has been discharged.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.260
Thank you.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.420
Are you here for your sister?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.100
I'm here for you.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.140
(It Is A Long Journey)

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.980
I'm not recording.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.540
Don't worry.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.420
I've been focusing on Sibei's incident

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.660
for a long time previously

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.420
without asking about you.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.300
Have you been doing well lately?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.340
Do you know that this concern

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.220
has come too late?

00:09:53.888 --> 00:09:56.460
I've been waiting for you
to ask this question for so long.

00:09:57.644 --> 00:09:59.780
However, you weren't here
when you were supposed to.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.900
Nothing matters now.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.540
I don't trust you.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.220
You don't trust me either.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.620
Stop asking me anything.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.780
Chuchu.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.020
Are you a good person

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.020
or a bad person?

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.900
You can see me as a bad person.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.300
A bad person won't call herself one.

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:36.140
You call yourself a bad person

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.866
because your conscience
is condemning you.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220
Tell me.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.540
Why did you lie?

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.900
You won't understand even if I tell you.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.220
I might not understand,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.020
but I know

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.540
you are Chuchu.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.300
You will never be a bad person.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.420
I am the last person who saw her.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.220
I wanted to lie for her

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.540
to prove her innocence

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.900
and help her
send Fan Jiancheng to prison.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.620
However, I didn't expect...

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.140
If I weren't

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.540
the victim that night,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.340
no matter how I cover

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.540
or explain it,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
it'd have been my crime.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.540
I saw people
questioning everything about me.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.140
My clothes,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.780
my outfit,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.220
and my relationship history.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.820
Everything about me.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.020
Ye Nianwen, do you know?

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.340
I've been doubting myself.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.140
I don't know
if doing sales is right for me.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.540
I don't know
if my outfit is right for me.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.220
I don't know

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.540
whether having a relationship

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.777
since I was in high school

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.140
was a grave crime or not.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.540
Everyone thinks I am wrong.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.020
Everyone.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.420
But I think I was not wrong.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.140
I've been fighting this...

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.660
But there's a voice

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.420
deep inside my heart telling me

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.820
that I was wrong.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.780
I wasn't supposed to do that.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.340
But you were the one

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.140
who gave Sibei the condom.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.660
That's the fact.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.900
Am I supposed to die because of that?

00:12:47.844 --> 00:12:49.266
Didn't I give her the condom

00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:51.340
because I wanted to protect her?

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.900
I wanted her to be well,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.780
yet I've become a sinner
beyond redemption?

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.020
Just tell the truth, then.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.020
You can't lie in court.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.780
You lied
and affected the judge's decision.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.900
The case should not be judged that way.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.020
Do you know

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.220
why I've never wanted
to tell you all these?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.100
I knew you'd say this.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.220
Do you think
I wanted to make a false testimony?

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.100
That's because I was afraid!

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.060
When I think about

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.420
how I was badly scolded online

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.420
because I left Sibei in the car,

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:37.562
I wouldn't dare think about
what they'd do to me

00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:41.420
if they found out I did something else.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.540
So, I felt lucky deep down

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.540
because if it's more pitiful

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.540
being a good person
rather than a bad person,

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.580
I'd rather become a bad person.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.300
Chuchu.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.980
When you say all these,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.660
doesn't it hurt your conscience?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.300
It does.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.740
Do you know
how long I've waited for you?

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.380
Do you know how long I have waited

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.940
for you to tell me

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.940
that I'm a good person

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.540
and you believe me?

00:14:30.968 --> 00:14:32.820
If you had told me these words,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.940
I would have had the courage to step up.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.300
I thought about stepping up many times,

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.420
but every time,

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.500
you,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.660
the people around me, and the internet

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.580
made me feel that I'd ruin myself

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.380
by stepping up.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.100
The only time I had the courage

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.488
that made me feel like stepping up

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.300
was when Sibei told me

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.500
that I wasn't a bad person.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.420
I don't get it.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.500
Why must you step up

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.940
only when someone else admits it?

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:10.420
You did the wrong thing.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.488
Isn't accepting your punishment
and making up for it

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:13.540
the right thing to do?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.180
Ye Nianwen,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.060
can you treat me as a human?

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.820
Not everyone will do
what one is supposed to do.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.500
You made everything seem so easy.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.260
In that case, Sibei

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.100
should have reported
to the police back then.

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:46.940
Why didn't you let her
make the police report?

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.500
Because you are human too.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.900
Aren't you?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.688
(Honorary Credential, Yang Qiyu,
Open Teacher's Lesson Second Place)

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.980
Captain Zhang, right?

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.940
Please come in.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.380
(Ticket Check)
Train 3299 is ready for departure.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.220
Please line up.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.980
You can send me off here.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.740
I'm not leaving for good.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.420
Suddenly, I feel like

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.940
you'll be gone for a long time.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.820
Nonsense.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.740
I'm leaving.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:03.420
You're not in a rush, anyway.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.380
Take your time.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.580
Sibei,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.820
do you know what I wished for just now?

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.060
What?

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.380
I wished

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.740
for Ye Sibei

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.580
to be safe and happy

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.020
forever.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.580
Why didn't you wish for me to get rich?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.940
They are just worldly possessions.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.660
Go on.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.580
Go to Guangzhou

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.260
and don't miss me.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.140
Don't turn around.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.060
Don't worry.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.420
I won't turn around.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.300
Dear travelers,

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.940
the ticket check for Train 3299

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.860
bound for Guangzhou
from Nancheng will be stopping.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.940
Dear travelers,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.380
ticket check for Train 3299

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.300
bound for Guangzhou
from Nancheng will be stopping.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.140
Actually,

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.140
since the day they got married,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.660
I wanted to tell Ye Sibei about this.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.260
However, Qin Nan wouldn't let me.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.820
Why not?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.980
Qin Nan didn't want to
pressure Ye Sibei.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.100
He said if I had told her that,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.111
Ye Sibei would feel like
she owes him something

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.900
in their marriage.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.940
Mr. Yang,

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.540
what kind of person

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.500
was Qin Nan

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.620
back then?

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.340
Qin Nan had dark skin.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.060
He was quiet.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.140
He usually hung around

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.380
with the hooligans of the city.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.700
He slept in class

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.380
or skipped class to play games.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.140
I scolded him many times

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.420
because of this.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.580
(One day,)

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.580
(Qin Nan)

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.260
(came to my office.)

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.100
Mr. Yang.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.580
Qin Nan.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.220
What's wrong?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.860
Is there still hope for me

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.020
to study well?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.860
Qin Nan.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.900
There's still hope.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.900
As long as you want to study,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.180
there'll always be hope.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.900
If you want to study,

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.780
I'll give you tuition.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.060
(Later, I asked Qin Nan)

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.100
(why his attitude
toward study had changed.)

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.500
(Nanbei Breakfast)

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.460
(He said)

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.940
(it was because of a female student
from the class next door.)

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.300
(The girl)

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.900
(was a good student in school
who had excellent grades.)

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.860
(After school,)

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.660
(she would always help out
in her family's stall.)

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.020
(Her positive character)

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.340
(touched Qin Nan a lot.)

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.660
(The girl)

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.490
(was Ye Sibei.)

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.980
(So, Qin Nan loved Ye Sibei a lot)

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.500
(and that began)

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.866
(when they were still at school.)

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.500
(Qin Nan's feelings for Ye Sibei)

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.900
(weren't love.)

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.500
(They were still young.)

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.020
(Moreover,)

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.822
(they didn't interact
with each other much.)

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.140
(I asked Qin Nan before.)

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.140
(He said these words to me.)

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.300
("Mr. Yang,)

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.780
(I'm very impressed with Ye Sibei)

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.420
(because she can do things)

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.500
(that I can't.)

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.660
(She gave me hope.)

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.300
(I only hope)

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.740
(she can live well.)

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.900
(If she can live well,)

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.700
(that will make me feel)

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.700
(that something in this world)

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.380
(can be changed through hard work.")

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.180
The next station is Yunwen Station.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.940
Travelers getting off at the station,
please get ready to disembark.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.580
The next station is Yunwen Station.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.460
Travelers getting off at the station,
please get ready to disembark.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.620
I remember
it was during the summer holidays.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.860
One day, at midnight,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.660
I suddenly received a call from Qin Nan.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.700
He didn't say a word

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.940
throughout the call.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.020
He was only weeping.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.580
In the end,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.060
he wailed.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.180
Later, I found out

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.020
his father had passed away.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.700
His brother died as well.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.140
Well...

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.660
Keep this 30,000 yuan.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.860
Take good care of your grandfather.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.500
(Since then,)

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.060
(Qin Nan)

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.980
(felt like a different person.)

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.940
(He always sat in class)

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.140
(without saying a word)

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.780
(or doing anything.)

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.060
(Drop Out Letter)
(Later,)

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.340
(Qin Nan)

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.420
(came to me)

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.940
(and told me)

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.460
(he wanted to drop out.)

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.780
Mr. Yang.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.780
Come in, Qin Nan.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.380
Mr. Yang,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.540
please deliver this

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.980
to Ye Sibei's home.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.580
Tell her

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.955
someone is giving her a donation.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.900
Qin Nan!

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.540
Qin Nan!

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.140
You will regret this!

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.900
The money

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.460
was for Qin Nan's education.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.660
It was also his future.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.380
He left his money for Ye Sibei.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.500
Deep down inside,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.580
he saw Ye Sibei

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.500
as a projection of himself.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.780
He hoped

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.660
Ye Sibei could do what he couldn't.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.820
If Ye Sibei could do it,

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.820
it would also motivate him

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.020
and show him hope in the world.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.020
Do you think

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.900
Qin Nan loves Ye Sibei?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.340
If you think so,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.900
it'd be difficult for you
to understand Qin Nan's actions.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.380
It is not love.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.340
Qin Nan sees Ye Sibei

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.780
as a religion.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.300
Hello.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.980
Don't get off.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.020
Lin Feng is following you.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.340
Head to Guangzhou.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.860
Don't stop.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.940
What do you mean?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.660
I wrote a letter with my message

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.940
and put it in your bag.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.340
Burn it after you read it.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.780
Don't leave any traces.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.500
You know what I'm going to do?

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.500
Sibei,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.780
don't come back.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.020
You must not be involved in this.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.420

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.500

Qin Nan,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.500
don't do something foolish.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.020
(When I was lost
in endless days of survival,)

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.460
(I thought about
how you were working hard)

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.380
(in life)

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.580
(so I kept struggling)

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:54.980
(and holding on.)

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.780
(My world was bleak)

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.740
(and cold.)

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.340
(You, who smiled in the rain,)

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.660
(gave me a bit of warmth.)

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.780
(You, who were radiant under the sun,)

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.980
(showed me a bit of light.)

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:15.940
Mr. Gao,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.780
have some water.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.820
How long have you been

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.790
a temporary worker here?

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.644
By tomorrow,
I'll have been here for a month.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.140
Not bad.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.220
Within such a short period,

00:36:27.222 --> 00:36:29.822
you've learned which spanners
to use when I repair cars.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.940
I was watching on the side

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.740
when you were making repairs.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.260
I remember everything.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.060
Do you like fixing cars?

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.140
I do.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.060
Do you want to learn?

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.900
I do.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.300
You can work for me in the future.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.780
Ye Sibei!

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.060
A call for you!

00:37:09.355 --> 00:37:11.060
Do you think
it's the caller from last time

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.500
who didn't speak?

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.740
I don't know.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.780
What's going on?

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.860
Thank you.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.700
It's all right.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.740
Hello.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.380
Hello.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.340
I am Ye Sibei.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.420
Hello. Say something.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.060
Why do you always call me
without saying a word?

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.780
Sorry.

00:37:34.866 --> 00:37:36.060
I called the wrong number.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.500
(I thought)

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.100
(I'd live my whole life)

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.220
(carrying my hopes for you.)

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.780
(However, when I met you again)

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.460
(after many years...)

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.380
(I don't know)

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.500
(what happened to you.)

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.820
(I could no longer see
a bright smile on your face.)

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.740
(You lost your radiance.)

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.140
(I couldn't see)

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.020
(the glow in your eyes.)

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.220
(I felt sad.)

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.740
(I was upset
to see you become like this.)

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.860
(I could accept how I gave in to fate)

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.940
(but I couldn't accept your change.)

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.740
(Your silence)

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.900
(made me fall back
into the icy cold world)

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.380
(So, I tried to approach you.)

00:39:34.425 --> 00:39:36.745
(I want to find
the radiant you from before.)

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.460
(That was how)

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.020
(I could breathe.)

00:39:46.888 --> 00:39:48.355
Let's get to know each other.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.260
Ye Sibei.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.860
Qin Nan.

00:40:07.911 --> 00:40:10.040
(However, I saw your weakness
and how you backed down)

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.140
(after we got married.)

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.220
(It felt like a thorn
stabbing into my heart.)

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.060
(I couldn't handle the fact
that my hopes for you since I was young)

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.500
(were completely crushed.)

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.500
(Guantian Police Station)

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.340
Sorry.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.740
(I felt weak.)

00:40:23.422 --> 00:40:25.070
(I felt the glimmer of light in my life)

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.600
(Divorce Agreement)
(getting dimmer)

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.260
(until it extinguishes completely.)
