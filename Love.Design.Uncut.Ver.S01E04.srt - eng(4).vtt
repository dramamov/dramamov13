What are you thinking?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.500
You’re asking to live at a client’s house?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.200
Sis, we need to spend time with the project we’re working on.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.900
That’s how we understand what the house truly needs.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990
After my mother’s funeral,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.900
I went back to Japan once again.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.380
I learned to smile again because of…

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.240
…a message from a stranger.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740
Do you remember what that message said?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.570
It said…

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.300
- I really love your artwork.
- I really love your artwork.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.550
How do you even know that?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.150
Because I’m the one who wrote it to you, sis.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.840
Between the two of us…

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.270
…maybe it really was destiny.

About what happened last night—

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.770
I just want to make things clear.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.300
That—

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.560
What happened between us…

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.560
didn’t cause any problem with work.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.220
It was just an accident.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.580
But you kissed me back.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.870
I was just acting as Khun Rain.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870
I might’ve gotten too into character, that’s all.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.740
I just wanted the project to come out the best it could.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.570
And then—

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.380
the moment took over. It was an accident.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.370
We’re on the same page, right?

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.100
Okay.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.180
If you say it was just work,

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.780
then…

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.600
let’s keep playing as Khun Rain and Khun Ming

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.570
Nope!

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.570
Didn’t you say you wanted the best result for the job?

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.670
This is work, right?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.090
Then we’d better give it our all.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.520
I just realized something.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.770
You’re the kind who hides behind “it’s just work.”

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.290
And I just realized you’re the kind who doesn’t give her all.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.700

Sure thing, my love.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.180
You’re still calling me that?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.050
It’s part of the job.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.500
What job exactly?

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.600
You’ve been there for a week, didn’t look like much progression me.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.740
I'll just go buy the coffee.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.270
Ugh.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.330
Why do they have to video call me now?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.260
What’s up?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.420
Hey, little sis!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.580
You sick?

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.020
Yeah, just got back last night. Not going to the office today.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.270
I need a break.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.520
You sound awful.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.820
Uh-huh. So, are you home?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.530
Yeah.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.740
Perfect.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.240
Then come open the front door for me.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.400
Uh…

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.580
Sis! Forgot to ask — how sweet do you want it?

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.780
Hmm.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.670
Seventy percent then.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.150
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.380
With that look—

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.990
I’d say a hundred percent sweet.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.830
So?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.730
Tell me what’s going on.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.380
How did you end up staying with Rin, huh?

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.730
Fine, I’ll admit it.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.460
Last week—

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.870
I stayed at Khun Rain's house with Rin.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.690
But—

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.060
It was for work, research purposes.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.350
- Sounds like someone’s got a crush on Master Rin.
- Mmm.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.900
It was necessary.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.060
- Okay?
- Yeah, sure.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.590
Any other reason?

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.280
Come on, spill it.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.240
Nope. End of story.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.770
Aokbab.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.150
Hey, what's you up to?

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.380
How’s the renovation going?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.000
So you really see me as your enemy?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.820
I do.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.980
But you know, right—

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.370
that I used to work with Khun Rain and Khun Ming.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.550
We known each other.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.260
So it’s not hard for me to understand what they want.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.780
And this competition—

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.150
won’t be hard for me.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.990
I’m confident in my team too.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.270
And I’ll never give up.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.910
Not to a thief like you.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.570
Honey

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.340
Have you been waiting long?

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.020
Took me a while to leave.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.660
It’s okay.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.720
Hey.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.340
Today’s the last day, you know.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.740
I heard they’ve got special deals today.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.580
If you see a house you like,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.230
we can go straight to the booth.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.150
It’s expensive, isn’t it?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.540
Then…

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.290
we don’t have to look yet.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.180
If I didn’t have to help pay my family’s debt,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.810
I would probably have more savings by now.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.700
And we wouldn’t have to rent a place together.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.860
I'm being with you every day like this—

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.990
already makes me happy.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.180
As for the house—

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.520
let’s leave that for the future, okay?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.170
For now, let’s just save up together.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.260
No rush.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.680
Thank you.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.870
Alright, let’s get straight to it.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.910
First question.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.770
Where did you two first meet?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.930
Oh, P'Rain and I—

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.090
We actually met in Japan.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.180
And we love visiting Japan every year to relive our love story.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.920
Wow, everyone else just follows drama filming spots—

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.550
That’s so sweet!

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.780
If I weren’t this close with you two,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.900
people would probably think—

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.740
the show just made it up.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.670
Ha,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.130
Believe me.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.080
Unexpected moments—

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.460
—are often when love finds us without us realizing it.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.300
But who could be as lucky as you, Khun Ming?

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.150
You’ll never know unless you try.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.910
Actually, we first met in Kitakyushu.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.660
Just like a scene from a drama, right, Ming?

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.760
It’s just work, my love.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.970
Kitakyushu is such a meaningful place for the two of us.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.230
We even got engaged here too.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.250
Isn’t that right, Khun Rain?

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.900
Ming once said—

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.940
if it weren’t for her business in Thailand, she’d move to Kitakyushu.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.350
- Sis, lets try being Khun Rain and Khun Ming in Japan—

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.620
Oh my god!

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.010
Thank you so much, P'Rain. You’re so cute.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.710
Thanks.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.130
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.420
I’m off then.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.580
Hmm… you’re really think it through about this, right?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.140
I’ll wait in the car then.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.980
- Bye!
- Take care!

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.990
Right now, whatever it takes for us to beat Mind Space—

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.370
I’ll do it all.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.110
When we say “think it through,” we mean—

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.160
you’re going with Master Rin alone, right?

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.820
Yeah, I’ve thought it through.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.000
Is there a problem?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.120
- Nope, not at all.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.700
Alright, go for it then.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.550
Hope you come back with some great ideas.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.110
I’m heading out.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.540
Bye-bye!

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.680
Chan.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.070
What do you think’s going on with those two?

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.540
Definitely more than just boss and employee.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.740
Ooh, the picture’s crystal clear—bye!

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.590
P'Vee.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.740
Is something wrong?

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.060
You look tense this early in the morning.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.010
It’s the same old thing.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.720
My family needs money again.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.260
Do you want to use mine first?

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.340
No.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.620
I don’t want to use your money.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.790
I’d feel bad.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.790
Besides, it’s my family’s issue.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.210
Your problems are mine too.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.680
We should face them together.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.770
And also…

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.420
I’m not giving it to you.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.580
I’m lending it to you.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.370
Okay?

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.250
I’m sorry, Tertis.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.780
Don’t blame yourself.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.690
And stop trying to handle everything alone.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.900
I’m actually happy, you know.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.330
That you care so much about your family.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.730
If we ever get married,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.340
I wonder how much you’d love me then.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.660
Can I have a hug?

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.970
These two roof corners are too sharp.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.220
- They should be rounded.
- Alright, just line them up properly.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.410
- There should be a bit of gutter showing.
- Professional, yeah.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.310
See, for a high-end house—when it rains,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.110
the water shouldn’t splash in front, right?

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.310
- Then let’s do both sides.
- Yeah.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.310
Sounds good.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.800
The overall look will be more balanced too.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.670
We can just do both sides then.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.740
P’Chan.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.300
Khun Aokbab and Rin are not coming in again today?

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.900
Aokbab went to Japan with—

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.780
Why the hell did you slap me?!

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.780
Mosquito.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.140
Might be life threatening

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.370
Mosquito...

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.570
About me and Rin going to Japan—

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.060
You two better not tell anyone in the office, got it?

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.070
Aokbab went to handle some business in Japan.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.100
Okay.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.800
What about Rin?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.500
If I come back and even one person knows—

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.130
you two are dead.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.210
Sure! No problem!

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.720
She ran off to brainstorm alone as usual

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.900
See? Even Rin’s out thinking about work.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.920
Maybe it’s my turn to “think” somewhere else too.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.420
Don’t even think about it.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.670
You and I still have tons of work to do.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.070
No skipping out.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.720
Try comparing these colors and show them to me later, okay?

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.500
How’s the renovation project for Khun Rain’s house going, Mind?

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.270
We’re almost done with the first draft.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.920
Vee’s team is handling it.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.220
Give it your all, Vee. This project—

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.930
—we have to beat Jinta, understood?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.170
What about the resort project I’m in charge of?

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.470
Yes.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.640
Understood.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.340
You can let someone else taking care of that one for now.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.870
Focus your energy on Khun Rain’s house project instead.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.960
Give it everything you’ve got.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.370
P’Thee probably wants to focus on this one the most.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.040
Got it, P’Mind.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.100
Don’t stress, I’ve got your back.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.970
The proper way to do is like this.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.790
Bow twice.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.480
Then clap your hands twice.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.940
Make a wish.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.350
And finish with one more bow.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.820
Please let everything go smoothly!

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.170
Did I do it right?

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.460
You know what, sis?

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.740
Khun Rain and Khun Ming—

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.870
—I bet they really believe in omens and sacred things.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.490
Why do you think that?

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.900
I saw a fortune stick paper just like this in Khun Rain’s office.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.970
She must’ve brought it from this shrine.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.660
And this shrine in particular—

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.410
—is famous for love blessings.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.650
What are you writing down?

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.580
The fortune paper.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.770
Might use it as inspiration for decorating Khun Rain and Khun Ming’s house.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.100
Khun Ming’s really into spirituality, isn’t she?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.770
Gimme that.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.420
I’ll sketch it for you.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.030
Pretty, right?

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.290
How do you think Khun Rain and Khun Ming fell in love?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.120
By coincidence, of course.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.860
I think coincidence—

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.870
—is the best way for love to begin.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.900
Maybe they…

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.430
…fell in love on a boat like this.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.850
That’s too dramatic.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.880
It’s not!

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.580
Oh sis! The view’s so pretty! I'll take a picture of you!

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.150
Enough already—my hair’s a mess.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.860
You’ll fall off if you keep doing that!

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.200
I can’t even swim!

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.800
Come on, hurry!

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.220
Rin, we’re here to work.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.190
Then I’ll take it myself.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.520
No way, people are watching.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.670
There are people everywhere.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.620
You’re ridiculous.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.700
I’m not ridiculous, I’m adorable!

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.740
Ridiculous.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.060
Rin.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.280
Let’s go.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.270
Okay.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.000
You know what?

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.990
Khun Ming once told me—

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.410
she never thought she’d fall for Khun Rain.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.180
Khun Rain wasn’t her type at all.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.260
But after spending time together,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.260
she started liking him more and more.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.250
Do you think that’s possible?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.230
To fall for someone you never planned to love?

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.740
What are you looking at?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.130
Seriously, what are you staring at?

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.540
Nothing.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.870
there nothing to look at?

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.300
What?

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.630
You’re so full of yourself.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.990
Hey, I saw you just now!

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.430
Let’s go already.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.330
What is it?

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.470
Really, what is it?

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.470
Ah, the weather’s perfect!

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.950
Are you cold?

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.200
- No.
- Not really.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.570
Mmm, that’s cute.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.510
Hey, sis.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.190
What if Khun Rain and Khun Ming—

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.370
—fell in love right here?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.250
How so?

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.530
just imagine it, sis.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:43.820
Oops!

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.320
Uh—

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.090
Oh! Sorry!

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.060
Are you Thai?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.800
Uh…

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.080
Yes.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.450
This place is, like, sooo beautiful.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.940
But my photos came out terrible.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.310
Can I see the pictures you took?

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.650
Oh, sure.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.260
My god—

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.930
It looks amazing. Can I have this picture?

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:16.940
Wait a sec—

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.070
Isn’t that a bit much?

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.270
Khun Ming made the first move on Khun Rain.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.280
Oh, okay.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.910
Sure.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.570
Um…

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.080
Then… can I get your IG?

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.420
Okay.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.800
Here you go.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.860
You got carried away.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.980
It’s called having imagination, thank you.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.470
Hey, let’s take a few pictures for reference.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.390
Might spark some design ideas later.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.920
It’s work.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.300
For work!

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.370
I’m being serious!

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.500
Come on.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120
Be a little sweet!

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.810
Can I have your IG?

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.720
I—

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.340
My account’s private.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.600
Even if it’s private, you can still accept the request!

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.420
Uh…

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.330
I’m an introvert.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.580
Even Introverts can be followed too!

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.140
Give it here!

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.790
So I can— sis!

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.190
Sis!

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.710
Did someone come to redecorate the house?

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.730
It didn’t look like this the last time I was there.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.500
Yes, ma’am.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.950
Another company came in and handled everything.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.410
They just left few days ago.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:14.850
Aokbab.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.910
Where have you been?

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.370
I’m confident in my team too.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.170
And I’ll never lose to a thief like you.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.540
I already told you, Mom.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.440
I don’t want anything to do with Dad anymore.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.730
But he’s very ill now.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.800
At least go see him one last time, dear.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.640
So you want me to go back—

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.910
—because you want me to take care of him again, right?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.500
I told you already.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.930
I don’t want to be involved with him or that family ever again.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.070
You and I have sacrificed enough for him and that house.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.710
Please, Mom… just let it go.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.320
He never cared about us anyway.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.940
[Japanese] I'm very sorry, but there’s no reservation under that name.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:46.900
Okay.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.960
Hmm… they said there’s no booking.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.110
What?

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.530
Our name’s not on the list again?

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.450
Don’t tell me you booked the wrong month like Tertis did.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.700
See for yourself.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.780
How could it be wrong? It’s correct!

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.720
What’s wrong?

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.540
It’s the wrong hotel, wrong branch.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:07.000
How can that be? It’s “Miracle Kyushu”!

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.230
Are you sure—

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.260
—you prayed for things to go smoothly?

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.680
Hmm… want me to find another hotel?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.590
No need. I’ll handle it. You just go sit still.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.700
I'm sorry!

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.640
It's the same It’s also Kyushu.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.640
Come on, who knows...

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.690
[Japanese] Do you have a reservation?

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.350
[Japanese] Yes.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.390
[Japanese] Welcome, this way please.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.600
This room’s not haunted, right sis?

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.700
Don’t jinx it.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.950
I’m kidding!

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:37.800
Hey—hey! Where are you going?

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.060
What?

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.290
Going to bed.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.370
You didn’t even shower. You’re all sweaty and gross.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.570
Sis, it’s freezing. Who sweats in this weather?

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.270
Can I shower tomorrow?

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.910
Tomorrow’s fine, right?

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.540
We’re in love anyway.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.380
A little dirty’s fine.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.230
You don’t mind, right… babe?

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.930
Babe, if you don’t shower—

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.830
—I’ll shower you myself.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.990
Are you serious right now?

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.420
Are you teasing me?

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.250
Then come on.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.720
Do it.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.930
thwack

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.500
Ow! That's hurt!

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.530
Go take a shower, dirty girl.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:26.700
You nearly made a hole in my head!

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.170
Hurry up, you stink.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.620
Where’s the bathroom?

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.280
The one we just walked past.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.220
Which one? There are so many doors!

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.960
On the right. Go!

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.690
You’d better take responsibility!

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.590
Mind Space just sent me their draft design.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.330
I really like it.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.740
I’ll be waiting to see yours too, Khun Aokbab.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.380
Here are five signs that you’ve fallen in love. Let’s hear them!

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.620
Number one — you’ll think of them without realizing it.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.620
No matter what you’re doing, they’ll pop into your head.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.820
Number two — you feel safe when you’re next to them.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.250
You just want to be near them all the time.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.940
Number three — you want to know everything about them, whatever they do.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.050
Number four — you want to take care of them.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.280
And lastly—

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.830
your heart beats faster whenever they’re near.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.580
Are you hurt anywhere, Khun Prim?

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.850
Uh, I’m fine.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.720
- Thank you for helping me, Khun Jade.
- You’re welcome.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.870
When you’re changing the lightbulb—

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.820
—make sure to switch the power off first.

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:12.600
Lucky I walked in just now, otherwise—

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.490
—you might’ve gotten hurt.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.330
Yes.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.530
Oh.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.860
Uh…

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.800
If you ever need to change a lightbulb again—

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.800
I’m a part-time electrician… and a bit of a lawyer too.

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:30.500
Thank you.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.740
I just worry that you might—

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.080
—get hurt. Then a regular customer like me would—

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.700
—have no one to make my coffee anymore.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:45.860
Right.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.970
Tis, let’s go home together.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.260
You go ahead first, I’ll head back later.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.760
I’m printing some files.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.000
Tis.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.540
You’re tiny! It’s late. You shouldn’t go home alone—it’s dangerous.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.870
It’s fine. I’ll just book a Grab.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.580
Grab, huh? That’s good.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.980
So we can split the fare.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.900
Hey babe, I’m almost there.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.760
P'Vee! Emergency!

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.800
We have to drop P'Yong off at his house first!

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.800
Huh?

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.890
I’ll explain later—just do exactly what I say for now.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.070
You’re not my girlfriend right now—you’re my Grab driver!

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.100
Huh?

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.200
Grab? Seriously?

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.650
Just play along! Gotta go!

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.050
This one, right?

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.820
Tertis.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.820
I think this Grab driver looks shady.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.670
Shady? No way.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.830
I book this driver all the time.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.680
Don’t worry.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.900
Hey, you.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.580
Hm?

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.000
Mind if I ask you something?

00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.900
What is it?

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.420
Why are you wearing a hoodie?

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.820
You kinda look like a robber right now.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.480
- P'Yong
- What?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.940
It’s fashion.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.700
Really?

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.770
How long you been driving Grab, honestly?

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.630
Uh…

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.500
About a year.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.800
So, how long have you known Tertis?

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.980
When’d you two first meet?

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.450
- P'Yong!
- What!

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.100
Stop interrogating her!

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.070
Of course I’m asking.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.870
For my baby’s safety!

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.590
Baby? You possessed or what?

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.460
Come on, let me give you a cheek kiss.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.010
What’s wrong with you?

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.920
My hand slipped.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:33.780
Uh-huh.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.480
Anyway, I’ll head home.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.170
Text me when you’re home, okay?

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.600
Please make sure my baby gets home safe.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.970
Or else, I can’t guarantee…

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.420
…your life.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.270
I’m off then.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.210
See you later.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.400
Bye-bye!

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.170
I can’t take this anymore!

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.400
P'Vee! P'Vee! Calm down!

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.700
Tertis, let go of me!

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.060
I’m gonna step on his face!

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.220
Who the hell calls my girlfriend “baby”?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.600
Let go, Tertis! Let me go!

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.760
P'Vee, don’t! Please don’t!

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.770
No one calls my girlfriend “baby” except me!

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:15.700
Let go!

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.820
I’m getting out of this car!

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.010
Calm down, calm down!

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.500
Hold me, just hold me— just hold me— Can you hug me instead?

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.370
Japanese people are so kind, aren’t they?

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.900
- They even gave us so many extras.
- Yeah.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.300
Let me see what you got.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.300
- So cute!
- Super cute!

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.870
Yeah, last time I came here, I met kind people too.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.270
Kind how? They gave you sweets?

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.100
Not just sweets.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.160
He gave me positive energy.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.770
When I was feeling down.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.320
Even though we didn’t know each other at all.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.770
[Japanese] What happened?

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.810
[Japanese] Miss.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.630
[Japanese] Did something sad happen?

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.330
[Japanese] Yes...

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.390
[Japanese] I lost something important.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.410
[Japanese] No matter how hard I look, I can’t find it.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:48.530
[Japanese] Ah...

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.260
[Japanese] I see.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.730
[Japanese] Here, have this to cheer you up.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.300
[Japanese] Good things will surely come your way.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.300
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.430
[Japanese] That stationery set—is it yours?

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:35.770
[Japanese] Ah, yes.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.330
[Japanese] It is.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.640
[Japanese] I’m an architect.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:46.370
[Japanese] - Really? I’m an architect too!
[Japanese] - Oh, really?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.870
[Japanese] I see.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.420
[Japanese] You like drawing too, don’t you?

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.070
[Japanese] In that case…

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.370
[Japanese] Shall we go drawing together?

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.230
[Japanese] Sure.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.700
[Japanese] You’re feeling better now, right?

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.460
[Japanese] Miss.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.340
[Japanese] Do you know—

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.660
[Japanese] Every drawing tells a story.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.570
[Japanese] Each one carries the artist’s emotions.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.860
If you love drawing that much—

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.090
—why don’t you draw more often?

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.000
I’ve hardly ever seen you draw.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.270
I’m not sure my drawings are good enough for anyone to like.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.930
I like!

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.690
I mean— I like...

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.760
—your drawings! The ones you make!

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.220
Oh, okay.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.610
Thought you were gonna say you like me.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.670
Whoa, you’re cracking jokes now?

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.670
You’ve improved your sense of humor!

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.420
Oh, did you know—

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.420
Khun Ming was actually the one who proposed to Khun Rain.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.820
Really? Khun Ming proposed first?

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.580
Yup—right here!

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.310
I saw it in the photo.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.440
She was kneeling like this—

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.440
—with this beautiful castle behind them.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.860
They’re lucky they found each other.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.330
Hey, sis.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.410
I think—

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.910
we should put a photo of their proposal in the house too.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:51.500
That’s a nice idea.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.620
See? Told you my ideas are great!

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.940
[Japanese] Congratulations! Congratulations!

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.130
Huh?

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.050
[Japanese] No, no—it’s not what it looks like! It’s not a real proposal!

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.480
[Japanese] It’s not like that!

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.480
Rin, let go! Rin, Rin Let go!

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.690
Congratulations again!

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.620
Rin, let go!

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.330
[Japanese] It’s not like that!

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.740
Let go!

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.980
Let me go!

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.190
[Japanese] No, really—it’s not what you think!

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.920
Sis!

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.550
Should we ask them for the photo? It looks like a proposal picture!

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.730
Rin, seriously, let go.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.120
This is so embarrassing.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.190
Wait, sis! Let’s ask for the photo first!

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.980
Hey!

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.310
Did Khun Ming and Khun Rain ever come here?

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.930
Nope, never.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.650
Huh? Then why are we here?

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.100
I—

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.450
I looked for you everywhere you drew.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.870
Even here.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.390
But we didn’t meet back then.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.250
But now… we have.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.300
Let’s take a picture to remember it—come on.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.150
Hey, we’re wasting time—shouldn’t we be working?

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.470
Just one picture—come here!

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.320
Rin, seriously, is this necessary?

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.370
Then—

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.130
I’ll take you somewhere.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.890
I promise you’ll get inspiration from it.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:44.470
- Where?
- Just follow me.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:45.820
Where are we going?

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.830
Three years ago…

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.140
I came here for a signing event.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.830
I’m a fan of the architect who designed this museum.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:18.070
[Japanese] Arata-san.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:25.370
[Japanese] I’m a huge fan of your work. I really admire your designs.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.790
[Japanese] I want to become a great architect like you someday.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:36.620
[Japanese] A good architect—

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:39.410
[Japanese] —is not only about skill.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.070
[Japanese] You must put your heart into your work as well.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.820
[Japanese] You can really put your feelings into your designs?

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.930
[Japanese] Yes.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:53.440
[Japanese] Architects don’t just design buildings and houses.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:58.140
[Japanese] We must also consider the way people live—

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.060
[Japanese] —and the emotions of those who inhabit and use the space.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.000
[Japanese] In every home—

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.700
[Japanese] —there’s a heart beating within.

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.500
[Japanese] Design with love and care in your heart.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.990
[Japanese] Thank you so much.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.090
He told me to design with my heart.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.070
I didn’t fully understand it back then—

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.820
—but it’s a lesson I’ve held onto ever since.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:11.100
Hey, sis!

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.740
Wait… this is—

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.340
The old man I told you about!

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.060
Really?

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:33.980
What a small world.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.260
Such a coincidence—just like us.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.230
Remember the old man in Japan I told you about?

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.480
I just found out he was a famous Japanese architect.

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.660
His name was Arata Isozaki.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.580
It feels like he’s still guiding me somehow.

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.010
So… what did you get from all this trip?

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:33.880
I’ll tell you when we’re back.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.090
Khun Chan!

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.950
Khun Pad’s calling a meeting.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:39.680
Looks like it’s really huge U.urgent this time.

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:41.570
- “Really hugh U.urgent”? What does that even mean?

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.710
- Man, it’s been meetings all day!

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.700
- I don’t know either, please hurry up!

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.930
This is the third or fourth time! He just keeps calling meetings!

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.700
- Yes
- What now!?

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.300
So? Got any new ideas yet?

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.490
Well…

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.290
It feels like something’s still missing.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.600
What do you usually rely on when you design?

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.270
The client’s requirements.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.860
Accuracy.

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:16.360
Suitability.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.260
And the overall composition.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.070
Wow, that’s… way too textbook.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.820
No wonder you’re stuck.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.820
Then what should I use if not logic?

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.240
Do you ever design with your heart—like Arata-san said?

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.320
Design with my heart?

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:33.840
What do you mean by that?

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:37.870
Like when you love someone—

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.850
You let your feelings lead the way.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.490
No logic. No reason. Just feeling.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.990
Coffee’s here.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.820
Ahh~

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.490
Why did you decide to leave the sketchbook here back then?

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.170
Hmm...

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:45.340
Well—

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.160
You mentioned this café before, remember?

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:51.270
So I thought maybe the owner would come back one day.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:54.510
And see? You really did come back.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.300
Thank you… for returning it.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.460
That sketchbook really means a lot to me.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.190
If you’re that thankful—

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.800
Then you owe me a big meal!

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.000
Of course I will.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.620
You said it! I’m getting A5 wagyu and omakase too!

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.430
You’re paying for everything, okay?

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:25.670
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.200
Yay~!

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:08.990
Hey—

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.660
Were you secretly taking pictures of me?

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:15.600
What? I was shooting the coffee—you photobombed it!

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.860
Let me see.

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:17.900
Nope~ not showing you.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.160
Give it here.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.020
Ha! You did sneak one!

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.260
So you’re really not giving me your IG?

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.540
I’ll think about it.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.200
You’re such a tease!

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.930
Finish your drink already.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.370
We’ve got another place to go.

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:50.720
Where to now?

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.220
Didn’t we finish the schedule already?

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.410
Not yet.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.410
Come on, hurry up.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:55.900
Oh—

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.730
Sis—

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.030
I’m tired~

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.260
Wait for me!

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:01.770
Hey, wait up!

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.780
Come on, we’re here!

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.050
Sis! Sis! I’m scared of heights—no way, I’m not going up!

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.220
- Wait, wait— I didn’t think you could be scared of anything!
- No, no, no! I’m not doing this!

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.190
You’re scared of ghosts! Why can’t I be scared of heights? Nooo!

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.020
Just hang in there—trust me, it’ll be worth it.

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.230
Please… I’m begging you, I’m not going!

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:28.750
Okay, fine.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:30.400
Alright.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.820
Then let’s go back, shall we? Let's go, Let's go!

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.800
[Japanese] Thank you very much!

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.700
- No, no—you can’t exit that way! That’s not allowed!
- Help, help meeee!

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:11.260
I’m seriously scared!

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.120
I'm mad!

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.310
You won’t find a view like this anywhere else.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:30.570
It’s really beautiful, wanna take a photo?

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.500
No thanks… I’m good.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:34.100
Come on then—give me the camera! Hurry up!

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:53.500
Oh…

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.530
So? Worth coming up here?

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.600
I believe you now — it’s totally worth it.

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.930
It’s so beautiful…

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:07.190
I didn’t dare to come up last time because it was so high.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.660
But if I had known it’s this stunning—

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.270
I would’ve come anyway.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.510
Still… kinda scared though.

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:15.240
My legs are shaking.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.400
Funny thing is…

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.840
When I came here alone,

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:26.720
the view wasn’t this beautiful.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.500
It’s more beautiful because I’m here with you.

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:40.700
Silly. The view’s beautiful on its own.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.860
You said it yourself — it’s prettier this time.

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:46.300
What’s with you?

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:13.980
Why are you holding my hand?

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:18.270
Because we’re role-playing Khun Rain and Khun Ming, remember?

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.360
I’m staying in character.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.710
If I were Khun Ming—

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.430
I’d tell Khun Rain that—

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:52.720
I’m really happy.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.270
To be here in Kitakyushu with you.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.490
I’m happy to have you.

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.100
And if you were Khun Rain—

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.500
What would you say to Khun Ming?

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:27.330
If...

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.550
I were Khun Rain…

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.120
I’d probably say—

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.360
I, too, love Kitakyushu…

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.430
where you’re here with me.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.680
I should take a picture of this.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:27.100
Khun Rain…

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.660
Do you think they would kiss here?

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:17.600
Wait— you’re not setting it private anymore?

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.170
Nope, not anymore.

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.180
What made you change your mind?

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.820
You wouldn’t even let me follow you before!

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.420
Well, you can now. Isn’t that good?

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.850
Yeah…

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
I love it!

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:57.380
Pick it up, sis.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.410
No...

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:16.770
Hello, Khun Mind.

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:21.420
May I ask what business you have with MY P’Aokbab?

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.740
What exactly do you want?

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:44.820
Babe, tell her what we’re doing.

01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:10.410
I have an offer for you.

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:13.320
It might just help Khun Tertis and Khun Vee.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:15.630
get the house of your dreams.

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.580
We’re not betraying each other.

01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:19.260
I’m counting on you, P'.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:23.640
We’re not in the kind of relationship where you can just call me.

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.670
We’re not even broken up yet.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:28.230
I know exactly what you’re trying to do.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.500
But it’s not gonna work.

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:32.590
You really think she loves you?

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:35.080
If she hesitates…

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:37.340
that means she doesn’t love you.

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:50.150
[Music]

01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:55.780
Love — I don’t know when it began, but it’s already here.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:09:00.570
I don’t really understand why… but it had to be you.

01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:07.640
I don’t know why — just seeing your smile feels like a beautiful painting.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:13.050
Like colors filling my heart with clarity.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.020
We might not always fit perfectly,

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.180
But still, I just want to stay close to you.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.980
You feel the same way, don’t you?

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:30.460
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.960
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:41.840
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.140
The one I choose today… is you.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:18.330
From not knowing my own heart, I found that you’re the love I’ve been searching for all my life.

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:24.810
Just having you by my side makes everything good today.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:29.310
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:36.190
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:41.490
The one I choose today is you.

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:45.030
How should we love each other?

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:50.070
Let’s design it with our hearts.

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:53.690
Because that’s how we’ll build a life together.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:11:01.510
From now on, every day will be colored with our love.

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:07.630
Just having you by my side makes everything perfect today.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:13.130
Listen to your heart — you’ll hear the answer is you (the answer is you).

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:19.330
There’s no reason for love, only that it has to be you.

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:24.710
The one I choose today is you.

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:30.090
I want you right here beside me.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:35.110
Always.
