Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.759
Take a look.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680
This is Nian'er Private Kitchen's
menu for the first week.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.479
I've prepared eight set menus in total.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.199
Meat and veggies are balanced.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.280
There are also all-vegetarian options.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.520
It can meet different customers' needs.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.879
No way.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.479
Eight types put too much pressure
on storage.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.879
You need to prioritize cost.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.759
But if you reduce the variety,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.039
there will be fewer choices.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.599
Naturally, customers will decrease.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.240
That also affects inventory.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.280
Then I'll buy some advertising.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
And run a promotion.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.520
You can refine the dishes more.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.280
Was my tone too harsh just now?

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.000
I...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.719
No.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:19.479
Sorry.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.360
Just replying to a message.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.840
It's fine.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.360
Okay.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.919
Why don't you take a look?

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.080
Is there anything else to discuss?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.159
Not for now.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.039
Alright.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.639
Then these application documents,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.680
I'll organize them again.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.159
I'll submit them to the office
after the holiday.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.080
Okay.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800
When you're done, just leave them
on the table.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.960
I need to go to the supermarket first.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.560
Otherwise, I won't have time
to make dinner.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.439
Alright.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.879
Thanks for your hard work.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.240
No problem.

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.319
Why are you back?

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.959
I missed you.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.079
Your hair's even straight now.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.319
Nian'er.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:38.759
I...

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.959
Let's talk at home.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.480
What do you want to eat today?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.279
I'll cook for you.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.000
How did you know I was here?

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.519
Didn't you install a tracking app

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.560
on my phone to find it before?

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.959
Do you still lose your phone now?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.759
Not often.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.120
Just occasionally.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.199
A little.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.759
The ones you like.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.680
Over there.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.319
Okay.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.480
I really like that one.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.600
This one.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:24.879
Don't eat that.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:25.680
Seaweed.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.519
Welcome home.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.879
Don't mess around.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:58.759
So nice.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.319
Ah.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.959
What's wrong?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.920
Why are you here?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.000
I just used the bathroom.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.879
I was about to leave.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.800
You were inside

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.399
and didn't make a sound.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.959
I was just about to come out
and say hi.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.120
You're leaving now, right?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.439
Yes, yes.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.399
I'm leaving now.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.879
We meet again.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.600
See you.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.160
If I'd known someone was home,

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.519
I wouldn't have been a third wheel.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.920
You misunderstood.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.720
Are you two dating now?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.319
No.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.160
Yin Zhanqi is a very practical guy.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.639
He pursues me just because he thinks

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.879
I'm a suitable candidate for marriage.

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.120
But that's not what I want.

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:12.920
Then why is he at your place?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.160
We're discussing opening
the private kitchen.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.399
Didn't I tell you all before?

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:19.120
Alright.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.879
Stop bothering me while I cook.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:21.720
Go play.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.840
Too bad Hui isn't here.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.799
First, stir-fry something simple
and tasty—

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.279
Chili fried pork.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.279
Today's spiral peppers are so fresh.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.320
Second dish—

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.519
Tomato vermicelli bass fillet.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:02.879
Diced tomatoes.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:06.200
Add two spoons of tomato sauce
and stir well.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.879
Add some water.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.039
Marinated bass fillet.

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:29.320
Put it in the pot and cook briefly.

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:37.919
Meanwhile,

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:39.720
make Cantonese sausage rice.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.440
Last dish—

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:43.960
Garlic clam vermicelli casserole.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.000
Zhenggui.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.960
Come help me out.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.879
Zhenggui.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.279
Li Zhenggui.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.799
Zhenggui.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:11.360
What did you do?

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.440
What?

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.840
I tidied everything up.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.279
You start causing chaos
as soon as you're back, huh?

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.039
I'm not used to it.

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:19.320
Messy is my style.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.879
Don't you think it's more lively
this way?

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.399
Hurry up and come out.

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.200
I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.519
Here I am.

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:32.720
You...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Come in first, come in.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.039
The suitcase.

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:37.720
I'll take it.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.519
Alright.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.080
Have some hot water.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.279
Didn't you say you'd come
the day after tomorrow?

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.480
Why did you come today?

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.279
And you didn't even tell me.

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.000
I could've picked you up
at the station.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.519
I just missed you.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.279
Wanted to surprise you.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.279
What about you?

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:09.720
Why did you come back too?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.879
Don't move.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:11.799
It's fine.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.879
Can you feel it?

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:21.919
The baby is kicking you.

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:24.919
It's all your fault.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.480
You disturbed the baby's rest.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.240
No.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.080
The baby is greeting me.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.159
Hui

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:35.120
Isn't your contract signing the day after tomorrow?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480
It's already signed.

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:37.279
Signed.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:39.080
What contract?

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:41.879
I turned my years of experience

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:43.559
into online courses and posted them.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.759
The results are pretty good.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.360
So an MCN company reached out to me.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.000
They want to discuss a partnership.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.159
Congratulations.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.320
Hello, Mr. Wang.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.639
Ms. Zhang.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.360
Please, have a seat. Please sit.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:02.919
I didn't know you were pregnant.

00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:04.600
And I made you come all this way.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.600
I'm really sorry about that.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.919
Mr. Wang, you're too polite.

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:08.679
How many months?

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:09.679
Over six months.

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:11.679
Congratulations.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.919
Ms. Zhang.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.279
You're pregnant,

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.080
yet you still teach so well.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.799
I'm impressed.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:17.559
Mr. Wang.

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:18.600
The course material

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.080
I'm very familiar with it.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.279
I can record and edit all by myself.

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:24.080
You really are capable.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.480
Do you want to rest first?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.039
No need.

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:27.840
We can talk about the contract now.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.519
Alright.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.600
This is the contract based on our previous plan.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.559
Drafted contract.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.679
See if anything needs to be changed.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.159
Okay.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.080
Sorry.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080
I'll step out to take a call.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.720
Alright.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.000
Mr. Wang.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.120
I've finished reviewing the contract.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.960
No issues.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.159
Should I sign now?

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.519
Ms. Zhang.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.399
I want to revise this contract.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:03.279
Is there a problem?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.039
Well...

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.519
That call just now

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:09.759
was from someone named Li Yihan.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:16.720
I understand.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:18.600
Ms. Zhang.

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:21.080
Your private life isn't our concern.

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:22.159
Young people,

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:24.080
having a rich love life is normal.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.720
But,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.759
if our company signs you,

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:30.919
if your private life gets exposed online,

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:33.360
our company will face huge risks.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.240
Mr. Wang.

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:40.480
This child is my ex-boyfriend's.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.720
We dated normally and broke up normally.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.960
I found out I was pregnant after we broke up.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.519
I want to have this child.

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:47.759
But I don't want to marry him.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:48.759
It's that simple.

00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:58.759
This is the agreement I signed with my ex.

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:01.279
He gave up custody voluntarily.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.200
I understand your concerns, Mr. Wang.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:06.400
If that's the case,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.880
I hope we can work together in the future.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:15.359
Ms. Zhang, wait.

00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:19.359
I really admire you.

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:21.720
Let's sign this contract together.

00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:29.640
Li Yihan is such a jerk.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.160
He only does things that hurt others and himself.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.720
No.

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:34.519
Then why did Mr. Wang

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.079
suddenly change his mind?

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:39.920
Maybe he thinks my image is good.

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:41.119
It could attract traffic.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.519
You...

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.799
Didn't you say you wouldn't come back?

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.160
Why are you here for Nian'er during the holiday?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.880
How are things at home?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.279
Sales grew to 28%.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.319
Profit margin rose to 41%.

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:05.799
Market share increased to 23%.

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:06.440
This...

00:18:07.279 --> 00:18:10.200
is our company's performance this quarter.

00:18:14.079 --> 00:18:15.480
I now officially announce

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.400
our company is out of trouble.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.519
Our next step

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.920
is to go public in the US.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.359
Great.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.480
Li Zhenggui

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.559
Li Zhenggui, wake up.

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:36.599
Li Zhenggui

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.920
Li Zhenggui, wake up.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.720
Mom.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:46.519
I want to rebuild the company with you.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.720
Rebuild what company?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.200
The company has already closed.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.440
Mom.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.559
I've worked hard for so many years.

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:59.000
I want to retire too.

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:01.000
And enjoy life.

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:05.880
My good daughter,

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:09.759
be sure to keep me company from now on.

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:12.200
We'll rely on each other, just mother and daughter.

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.160
But I want to care for you with Dad.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.119
Don't mention him to me.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:21.599
In this lifetime,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.200
I never want to see him again.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.359
All these years,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.839
all those affairs and mistresses...

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:28.079
I've had enough.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.480
Now,

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:30.880
I don't want to tolerate anything.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.799
Anyway,

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:34.359
the assets he got

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.920
he can spend on whoever he wants.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.519
Mom.

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:47.000
I'll work hard for sure.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.079
So you can have a happy retirement.

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.319
Alright.

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.200
Silly child.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.480
You...

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.920
As long as you can support yourself, that's enough.

00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:00.920
My painting work now

00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:02.039
is going pretty well.

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:02.680
Good.

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.519
Nice, Li Zhenggui.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:08.400
You're on a roll now.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.440
My work isn't really a roll.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.200
But my picture book got a reprint.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.720
That's great.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.200
Congrats to you too.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.759
I've figured it out.

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:21.319
I think success isn't the most important.

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:24.279
The most important is settling yourself.

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:28.079
Right now, dinner is most important.

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.119
I'll go get ready and start dinner.

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:57.400
I'm so glad you could come back today

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.920
and spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with me

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.680
It makes me truly happy

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.079
I feel like I am

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:05.519
the luckiest person in the world

00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:44.160
A toast to dinner

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.319
A toast to dinner

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.200
What's wrong

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.880
Are you feeling unwell

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.079
Call someone

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:03.279
Li Zhenggui, make the call

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.119
Call who

00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:07.680
Call 120

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:10.119
Can you walk

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:14.839
Go slowly

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.319
Li Zhenggui, your phone

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.279
You're all still here

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.799
Thank you all

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.960
for sharing so many sunsets and fireworks with me

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.680
Over the past year

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:59.319
I've been walking gently through life

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:01.119
in a life of sudden winds and rain

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.279
Life isn't just pure happiness

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.160
Joy always comes mixed

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.680
with anxiety and unease

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.519
We all brave the storms to make a living

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.079
I hope you all find peace

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:16.599
Yes

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:19.160
Hui and Li Zhenggui are both doing well

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:21.400
They're taking good care of themselves

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:23.400
You should remember to eat well too

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.880
I'll be somewhere in the world

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.319
having dinner with you

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.400
Goodbye, my friends

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:33.880
We'll meet again
