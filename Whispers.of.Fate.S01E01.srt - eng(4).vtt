[Episode 1]

She sold herself
to pay for her father's funeral?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.630
Yes.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.180
Haven't you heard?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.800
The City Lord

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.560
bought her from the outskirts.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.700
He's old enough

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.070
to be her father.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.430
I was wondering.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.150
A young and pretty girl like her

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.120
wouldn't willingly become his concubine.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.560
Alright.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.030
Stop it.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.560
Drink up.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.370

Come.

Here!

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.620
Congratulations.

Fill it up!

What a good drinker!

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.470
Gluttony.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.140
Lust.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.600
You're steeped in sin.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.550
You deserve...

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.150
a killing song.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480
As I just mentioned,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.870
everyone

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.070
in the Hao Residence—

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.430
over 100 lives—

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.490
died in an instant.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.770
The bodies had no external wounds,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.950
but blood flowed

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.159
from their ears.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.590
Such a scene

[Jinhuayin Tea House]

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.110
inevitably reminds one

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.390
of the long-lost martial art technique—

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.050
the Sound Killing Technique.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.159
Ten years ago, on Tiandu Peak,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.950
the seven greatest martial artists
of jianghu

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.480
fought a fierce battle
against the imperial advisor

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.000
of the former dynasty, Yique Yinyang.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.350
That battle turned heaven and earth
upside down,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.760
with blood flowing like rivers.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.730
[Knows Everything in the World]

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.530
Eventually, it brought the peace

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.320
jianghu enjoys today.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.750
Among them,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.180
Fang Zhou, the head of Zhoudi Tower,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.620
relied on

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.690
the Sound Killing Technique.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.040
It's said that in Zhoudi Tower,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.570
aside from Head Fang,
who excelled at the qin,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.160
his disciples
were each skilled in other instruments—

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.310
the flute, the pipa, and the drum.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.680
Who would have thought four years ago

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.430
Head Fang was ambushed,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.640
Zhoudi Tower fell into ruin,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.600
and his disciples

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.900
went missing without a trace?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.070
Now,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.560
a black-clad pipa player

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.140
is wreaking havoc in jianghu
with the Sound Killing Technique,

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.400
acting with impunity.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.720
Some say this person

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.480
is none other than a disciple

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.480
of Zhoudi Tower

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.960
who went missing in that incident.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.630
Upon hearing the news, Shao Yanping,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.560
Sword Master
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.040
dispatched his last disciple,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.970
Zhong Chunji of the Shanfeng Sect,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.840
to lead some Sword Sect disciples
to Yanxian,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.720
vowing to capture

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.230
this jianghu villain

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.320
and make them pay blood for blood!

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.670
Ms. Zhong,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
just now, this woman gave us

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.690
a description
of the black-clad pipa player.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.430
I've told you everything I know.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.820
I really don't know anything else.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.820
I truly don't know that person.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.039
Mr. Yang,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.400
what's going on here?

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.840
Who authorized you to torture her?

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:40.870
Ms. Zhong,

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.549
do you know what a tragedy

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.270
the wedding banquet turned out to be?

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.790
Over 100 people

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.990
were killed that day.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.720
She was the only one unharmed.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.240
This is extremely suspicious.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.030
I suspect

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.000
she's an accomplice of the murderer.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.910
Besides, Hao

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.030
once saved my life.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.550
I just wanted to find out
the murderer's whereabouts

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.480
as soon as possible,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.360
so I...

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.000
Mr. Yang.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.480
Do you have any evidence?

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.720
Abuse of torture

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.240
violates the principles
of the Sword Alliance.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.040
You must be aware of this, right?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Release her!

Release the suspect.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:13.910
Yes.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.030
Mr. Yang.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.910
She's not even a suspect yet.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.530
I'll report everything

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
that happened here

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.460
to Master Shao.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.840
Miss.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.350
It's alright now.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.180
Don't be afraid.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.960
Thank you, Miss.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.660
No rush.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.240
It's okay now.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.720
I'll ask you a few questions.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.200
Just answer truthfully.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.280
The Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.200
will never wrong an innocent person.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200
Please ask, Miss.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.700
What did you see

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.670
that night?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.550
Did you hear anything

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.550
unusual?

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.780
At the time,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.150
I heard

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.750
a haunting sound of the pipa.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.440
Suddenly, my limbs felt weak,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.920
and my mind started to fade.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.840
I don't know how long it took,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.480
but when I slowly regained consciousness,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.750
everything around me was deathly silent—

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.510
so quiet it was unsettling.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.720
It's your wedding night.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.050
Why aren't you smiling?

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.900
Answer me, Miss Shei.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.650
Remember my face.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.120

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.870
He deliberately left a survivor

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.150
to identify him?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.000
Why?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.960
Who cares?

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.870
This time, we finally know

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.440
what he looks like.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:32.960
My Lord,

the culprit has been found.

[Jinye Temple]

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.240
I wonder

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.080
what kind of spell

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.360
you used on the Abbot.

And what happened?

You didn't follow the Buddhist teachings

or help out at the temple.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.440
One of you just drinks tea

and carves wood every day,

and the other only steals chickens
and sleeps in.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.960
You're grown men,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.670
yet you spend your days lazing around.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.080
And you have the nerve to make me,

a child, serve you?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.750

May I ask who

Are you the city lord of Yanxian

or a gang leader?

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.120
Go now.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600
Be careful, Miss.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.960
Ms. Zhong, don't forget,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.510
this case involves many parties.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.200
Jinye Temple dares to harbor a suspect.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.750
Everyone there

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.080
could be an accomplice.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.370
Go in and search!

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.030
Yes!

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.200
I finally got

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.510
a chance to sleep,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.880
and now
there's a pack of wild dogs barking.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.090
I'll count to three.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.000
Anyone still here after that

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.880
will face the consequences.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.960
Who are you?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.030
One.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.480
Where is he?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.870
How did he disappear?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.130
Insolent rogue!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440
Search the place!

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.510
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.480
The Moon-crossing Ring?

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.720
You are Cloud,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.790
Chi Yun?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.600
Where did you take Miss Shei?

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.240
Judging by his lightness skill,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.090
he must be that guy's henchman!

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.910
Three.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.750
My Lord!

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.440
My Lord!

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.610
Whether I'm a gangster or not

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.360
isn't for a coward like you

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.000
to decide.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.360
Chi Yun,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.960
give Miss Shei back to us now.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.120
So you can take her back

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.450
and keep torturing her?

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.390
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will investigate this thoroughly.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.000
We will not wrong the innocent
nor let the guilty go unpunished.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.360
Forcibly taking someone

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.150
is a crime too.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.640
Which stupid Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.240
thinks it can boss me around?

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.110
His name is Feng.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.500
He just got woken up.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.510
Would you mind

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.770
calming him down?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:02.960
You...

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.890
It really is you.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.000
Miss,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.500
have we met before?

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.190
You look exactly like him,

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.170
but your gaze is completely different.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.100
Sound Killing Technique?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.070
Now,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.100
does anyone else want to go in?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.830
The expert in the inner courtyard

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.580
is formidable.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.840
We are no match for him.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.260
But I must see him in person

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.720
to clear him of suspicion.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.090
Please lead the way.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.200
Miss Zhong,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:04.830
you...

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.120
Heroine,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.870
you've got guts.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.270
I admire that.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.070
This way, please.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.650
The rest of you,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.350
go back and wait for news.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.960
Move.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.210
What did you say?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.280
Miss Zhong!

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.400
If you dare to harm Miss Zhong

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.660
even a hair on her head,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Master Shao
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.590
will not let you off!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:39.960
Just now, what...

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.030
what did he say?

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.960
Miss, put this on.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.270
Don't catch a cold.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.720
Tang Lici.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.720
Miss Shei!

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.440
I just asked you to help me

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.640
look after this lady.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.420
I didn't ask you to steal my thunder.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.670
Who asked for your help?

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.930
Did you lose the fight?

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.440
I, the mighty Cloud, I...

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.240
If you didn't lose,
it didn't really count as help.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160
That makes sense.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.960
Is he the murderer?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.480
The murderer...

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.570
looked like him.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.930
Looked like?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.110
Their build and appearance

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.310
are exactly the same.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.400
But...

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.400
I just witnessed

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.070
your Sound Killing Technique.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.790
Could you

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.530
be from Zhoudi Tower in Jiangnan?

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.830
I am Zhong Chunji
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.400
I request your cooperation

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.330
in investigating
the Hao family massacre 3 days ago.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.480
Chi Yun.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.310
Get up.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.440
Me?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.750
Get up.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.440
Sir,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.150
between 7 and 11 that evening, 3 days ago,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.640
where were you,

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:09.800
what were you doing,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.480
and who can vouch for you?

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.110
You know

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.830
you're no match for me.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.030
Why did you come in to see me?

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.640
If I die,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.150
it will prove your connection
to the massacre.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.200
Exchanging my life

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.310
for the truth

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.230
is worth it.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.380
You're Shao Yanping's disciple?

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.240
Shao Yanping is indeed my master.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.270
Just as I thought.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.160
Otherwise, how could you speak of

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.160
exchanging your life for the truth?

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.480
You know

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.110
you're no match for me.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.300
Why did you come in to see me?

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.960
I am investigating this case
under the Sword Alliance's orders.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.640
If you continue to evade my questions

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.830
and just seek to humiliate me,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.110
then do not blame me

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.920
for arresting you as a suspect.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.640
You know you're no match for me.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.830
Why did you...

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.930
come in to see me?

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.830
You...

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.640
Foxy Tang,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.640
Did you drink so much tea

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.300
that you damaged your throat?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.860
Why do you keep repeating
this one sentence?

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.240
I see.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.310
Mr. Tang,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.640
I will come back.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.160
Miss Shei,

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.320
I'll take you back.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.010
Miss Shei will be safer

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040
if she stays here.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.000
Then I must trouble you

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.000
to take good care of Miss Ashui.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.550
Miss Zhong.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.400
Thank you.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.750
You're welcome.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.280
Foxy Tang.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.030
What riddles

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.080
were you two playing at?

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.830
Miss Shei,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.720
do you understand

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.180
the questions I asked her?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.350
So I'm the only one

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.780
who doesn't get it?

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.440
Since you don't get it,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.280
why didn't you ask?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.110
Isn't that what I'm doing?

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.440
Asking me won't get you an answer.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.360
I'll go ask Shao Yanping's disciple.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.050
Chi Yun.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.310
If you see Miss Zhong,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.240
ask her one more question for me.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.100
What question?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.810
What is the one thing

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.110
everyone did

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.950
at the wedding banquet

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.830
except the bride?

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.000
Fine.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.350
If you're not the murderer,

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.680
then why

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:40.610
do the two of you

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.870
look exactly the same?

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.190
Naturally, it's because

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.890
we once knew each other.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.680
You know

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.510
who he is?

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.040
An enemy of mine.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.490
He disguised himself as me

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.160
to take revenge on me.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.920
Mr. Chi?

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.300
Where are your henchmen?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.120
I told them
to go to the Hao Residence first.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.110
I want to investigate alone for now.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.750
Mr. Chi, did you rush here

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.530
for something urgent?

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.960
What exactly

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.250
did Foxy Tang say to you?

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.510
Mr. Tang just

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.710
asked me 3 questions.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:42.790
Weren't you there

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.830
listening?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.640
I didn't understand.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.880
The 1st question

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.680
Mr. Tang asked

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.530
was why I wanted to see him.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.550
I came because the Sword Alliance

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.810
sent me to investigate

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.110
the Hao family massacre.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.440
As for the 2nd question,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.340
it looks the same,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.000
but it actually

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.600
has a different meaning.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.110
It means that if Mr. Tang
were truly the murderer,

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.880
we'd clearly be no match for him.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.740
So why didn't he

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.530
kill me and Miss Shei?

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.110
And...

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.140
why didn't he run away?

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.790
I see.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.150
What about the 3rd question?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.180
As for the third question,

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.110
what Mr. Tang really wanted to ask

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.310
was actually...

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.270
Why...

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:27.750
do you...

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.650
suspect me?

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.750
He wanted me to consider

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.550
why Miss Shei identified him.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.510
Remember what I look like.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.570
And that reason is,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.310
of course, that Miss Shei

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.240
saw the murderer

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.600
and could point out that

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.680
Mr. Tang looks the same as him.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.000
Got it.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.960
Why didn't he just say so?

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.440
There's one more question—

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.590
one that Foxy Tang

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:51.920
later told me to ask you.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.830
What is something everyone did

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.960
at the wedding banquet

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960
except the bride?

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.550
This case is shrouded in mystery.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.160
Among those we know,
the only suspicious one

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.400
is Yang Shangqing.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.720
Why do you

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.960
suspect him?

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.030
Because Miss Shei

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.190
was clearly the victim,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.400
yet Yang Shangqing tortured her severely.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.720
He was obviously in a rush
to close the case.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.480
That makes him

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.340
highly likely to be the murderer.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.000
I've long suspected

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.530
that Yang was the murderer.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.100
But the coroner said

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.510
the victims died
from the Sound Killing Technique—

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.270
no

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.240
external wounds,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.960
only bleeding from the ears.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.640
Well,

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.830
Miss Shei

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.720
really did see

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.850
the black-clad pipa player

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.970
who looks like

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.750
Mr. Tang.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.480
But we can't find a single trace

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.640
of this pipa player.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.640
So now,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.240
let's think about

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.730
the other question from Mr. Tang.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.640
What is something

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.110
everyone did at the wedding banquet

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.350
except the bride?

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.720
Tender black-bone chicken!

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.110
Fine osmanthus wine!

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:52.920
Sir!

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:53.920
Sir!

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.070
We just got some

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.400
especially tender black-bone chickens.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.540
When paired with osmanthus wine,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.790
it tastes simply divine.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.720
How about it?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.380
Would you like to give it a try?

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.520
Then let's go...

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.030
-have some chicken first!
-That's drinking!

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.720
What everyone at the wedding banquet
would do

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.960
except the bride

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.620
is drinking the wedding wine.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.250
Let's go.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.420
Examine the bodies.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.370
Check, please.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.920
A good banquet must come with fine wine.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.800
Who would have thought the fine wine

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.860
would be poisoned?

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.350
No signs of poisoning?

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.830
Could we have guessed wrong?

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.630
That's right.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.310
If they were really poisoned,

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.510
the coroner wouldn't have missed it.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.590
Since Foxy Tang asked such a question,

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.160
it must be on the right track.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.640
You trust Tang Lici that much?

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.770
Who says I trust him?

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.030
It's just that

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.750
he always looks

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.960
so confident.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.640
He must have thought it through
before speaking.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.230
So the direction must be correct.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.700
The cause of death really does resemble
the Sound Killing Technique.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.560
When falsehood stands for truth,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.790
truth likewise becomes false.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.680
Could it be...

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.590
Chi Yun,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.570
is there a poison

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.270
that can make one's ears bleed,

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.640
making it look like
the Sound Killing Technique,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.840
but is hard to detect?

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.490
There's no such poison.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.530
There is.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.160
Baibusha.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.310
Baibusha?

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.140
You're not in the underworld,

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.790
so you don't know

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.920
these dirty tricks.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.490
This poison is colorless, odorless,

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.960
and has no medicinal properties.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.220
When dissolved in water,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.280
even the best doctor can't detect it.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.720
But if consumed

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.640
with osmanthus wine within an hour,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.840
it becomes deadly.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.670
The symptom is

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.040
bleeding from both ears.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.510
How can we prove it?

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.160
The well.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.480
Water is needed for cooking,
boiling tea, everything.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.510
And before the banquet,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.840
guests would drink tea.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.240
So the well

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.170
must hold clues.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.510
I'll go to the wine cellar
to find the osmanthus wine.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.340
You take people

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.750
to find the leftover wine
and food from the banquet.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.830
If I'm right,

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.570
they won't detect poison
in them separately.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.170
Let's meet at the well later.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.110
Just as you said,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.000
we didn't detect poison

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.010
in the food and wine.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.920
Now, let's mix

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920
the wine and water

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.520
to see if my guess is correct.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.030
Sure enough, it's poisoned.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.070
Everyone in Yanxian knows

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.720
Hao Wenhou loves osmanthus wine.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.650
For his wedding,

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.750
he would certainly serve

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.200
osmanthus wine to his guests.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.310
When the host toasts,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.440
everyone must drink

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.590
except the bride.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.070
It's about time.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.030
The coroner only tests for poison

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.350
by inserting
a silver needle into the throat

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.740
to see if it changes color.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.540
But Baibusha and osmanthus wine

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.590
passed through

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.880
the victims' throat separately.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.610
They must have thought of this.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.590
That's why the coroner

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.050
didn't detect any poison.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:43.680
This proves

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.010
they didn't die from the Sound Killing...

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.000
Technique.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.000
Foxy Tang,

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.030
you didn't expect me

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:51.550
to figure it out

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.680
so quickly, did you?

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.330
It's only because I've seen so much

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.330
that I could clear your name so fast.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.550
And you...

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.550
Wait.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.590
I think I've been set up.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.240
What's wrong?

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.300
Foxy Tang worried
you wouldn't find the truth

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.240
since you know nothing about poisons,

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.110
so he said all those things

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.960
I couldn't understand

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.090
to spark my curiosity.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.880
That's how he got me
to help you solve the mystery...

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.140
and uncover the truth.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.470
This...

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.860
Damn that Foxy Tang!

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.530
He tricked me again!

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.830
Your Sound Killing move yesterday

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.060
was powerful.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.010
Looks like your injuries
are no longer serious.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.580
But if you want to stay alive,

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.840
it's best not to use your martial arts.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.510
Forget it.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.570
You've been recovering here for 6 months.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.320
No one has come looking for you,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.790
and you have never left the temple.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.430
Yet worldly matters

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.000
still found their way to you.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.130
Abbot, are you displeased with me

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.000
for the trouble I brought yesterday?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.200
You didn't bring trouble.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.940
Mr. Chi has been eating chicken secretly

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.530
in the temple—that's trouble.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.190
What you brought was karma.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.640
Abbot,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.070
what exactly is karma?

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.780
The doer is the cause,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.920
and the receiver is the effect.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.990
If someone

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.890
kills because of me,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.590
or if an innocent

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.300
suffers because of me,

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.730
is that my karma?

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.160
It depends on whether you know

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.070
and whether you tried to stop it.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.370
If trying to stop it

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.510
causes more deaths,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.440
does that still count as compassion?

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.640
The wind blows the tiles on the roof,

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.600
and a tile falls and hits my head.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.000
I don't blame the tile,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.960
for it is not free.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.000
Is it the wind's fault,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.310
the tile's fault,

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.400
or mine

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.830
for standing beneath the roof?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.250
It's your mistake, Master.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.610
You made a mistake.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.020
You lost 3.5 points in this round.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.440
Amitabha.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.520
How interesting.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.160
Your question

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.610
is both false and true.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.960
True and false, false and true—

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.270
perhaps you even deceived

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.350
yourself.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.090
My surname is Fang,

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.590
my courtesy name is Pingzhai,

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:54.450
and my nickname

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.680
is Carefree.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.750
I rarely do good deeds in my life.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.030
Delivering a letter for someone

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.490
is actually a first for me.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.200
I bought

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.110
a piece of news

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.370
in a mysterious tower,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.920
yet forgot to tell them.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.980
You'd better send someone discreet.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:16.090
[To Tang Lici]

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.600
Oh, right.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.070
The message has been delivered.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:22.199
What a coincidence.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360
Someone else also asked

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.670
the same tower

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.230
you entrusted

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.760
to deliver that thing here.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.960
I just don't know
if it's a real coincidence...

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.190
or not.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.540
A half jade flute?

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.159
Sir,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.710
could this

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.429
be your karma?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.430
Sir.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.280
Sir?

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.610
Does it hurt?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.240
How could someone like me

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.730
even know what pain feels like?

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.190
I'll go check on Miss Shei.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.800
Chi Yun,

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.840
I still feel something's off.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.440
What's off?

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.690
What's Mr. Yang's motive?

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.190
We don't need to guess.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.190
It all comes down to profit.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.670
If it's really

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.400
such a simple, shallow reason,

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:02.840
it proves

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:03.920
Mr. Yang

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.250
isn't a man of great wit.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.530
Then how could he

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
think of using the Sound Killing Technique

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.200
to cover up his crime?

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.600
What do you mean?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.260
Hao Wenhou and his guests died horribly,

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.880
and Miss Shei didn't clearly see

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.800
the black‑clad pipa player

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.920
who resembled Mr. Tang.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.190
But we've proven

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.510
Hao Wenhou and the guests

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.570
died of poisoning.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.800
So where did that black-clad pipa player
come from?

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.660
Four years ago,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.750
Zhoudi Tower was wiped out overnight.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.510
And the Sound Killing Technique
has long vanished from jianghu.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.840
If Mr. Yang really could

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.710
find a successor

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.320
of the Sound Killing Technique

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.920
to cover up

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.360
his crime,

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.440
he wouldn't have chosen

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.320
such a despicable method

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.760
as poisoning in the first place.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.480
And he did it so secretively,

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.890
as if he was hiding something.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.440
Are you saying

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.050
someone wants to frame Foxy Tang?

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.250
What do you want?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.650
Beat Yang Shangqing

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.630
for 3 days,

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.840
and he'll confess to

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.350
even stealing the dog lost
in the next city.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:54.950
Just wait!

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.000
Chi Yun!

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:57.670
You can't do that!

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.270
That's a forced confession.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.590
Hurry!

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.880
Hurry up!

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.150
Be careful!

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.960
That's my family heirloom vase!

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.990
My vase!

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.000
My Lord?

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.430
What are you doing?

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.880
The silver's all on the ground.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.280
Are you trying to run away

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.370
now that you can't hide it anymore?

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.380
Everyone, listen!

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.230
I'll give half my gold

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.260
to whoever kills this man!

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:37.880
Kill him!

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.800
Kill!

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:43.440
Kill him!

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.150
Hero,
your martial skills are truly impressive.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.400
All this silver is yours.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.880
Servants!

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.230
Take it to this hero.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.030
Tell me.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.450
Why did you try to frame Foxy Tang?

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.080
Please come in, sir.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.320
You just got out of prison

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.880
and are already in the mood

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.480
to play with these trinkets?

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.510
Today I saw Feng

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.050
and took a liking to him.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.120
Besides,

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.190
after all the ups and downs
I've experienced recently,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.480
I always want to find something to do

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.610
to distract my mind.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.920
What I did was improper.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.340
Mr. Tang, I hope you and your wife
won't take offense.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.400
I don't have a wife.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.790
I just picked him up on a whim.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.670
How pitiful.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.630
Luckily, he met you,

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.100
and you kindly took him in
and have been taking care of him.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.260
It must be fate.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.600
You're wrong.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:35.760
I just did it on a whim

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.000
to see what it felt like

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.930
to adopt a child.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.960
But didn't you

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.070
give him a name?

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.030
A name

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.840
creates a bond.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.190
One of a kind in a millennium,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.600
break with old words.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.440
So I'll call you

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.840
Tang Lici.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.110
Now I see

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.840
that no matter what,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.400
I am not him.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.550
Man on earth...

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.760
Man on earth...

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.030
Good at birth.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.030
Good at birth.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.200
The same nature...

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.150
The same nature...

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.440
Miss,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.650
you married into the Hao family

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.000
to get the money
to pay for your father's funeral.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.960
Now that you've gone through
such a calamity,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.410
if you feel uneasy,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.360
you might seek the Abbot

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.100
for a talisman of peace.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.840
It's quite effective.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.070
I have no way to repay

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.000
Lord Hao's kindness.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.400
Miss Shei,

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.580
you confuse me.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.040
You're a part of the scheme,

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.310
yet you know nothing

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.590
about it.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.320
I...

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.760
It seems

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.880
you're just a pawn

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.840
he used and discarded,

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.360
a catalyst to start his game.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.920
But what did I do wrong

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.070
to become this discarded pawn?

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.400
If I'm a discarded pawn,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.200
what role are you playing

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.480
in this game?

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.280
Chi Yun!

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.250
What are you doing?

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.360
Miss Zhong!

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.440
Miss Zhong, please save me!

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.890
He's trying to kill me!

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.980
Give me 30 minutes,

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.630
and he'll confess everything.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:30.190
Chi Yun,

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.320
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.800
never forces confessions through torture.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.130
Truth comes from careful investigation.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.390
All the evidence is laid out on the floor.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.320
Can't you see it?

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.480
He sent someone

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.110
to secretly follow us,

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.380
and when he was exposed,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.070
he tried to run off with the money.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.590
Run off with the money?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.280
I'm just...

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.710
Mr. Yang!

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.360
Moving!

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.590
Please explain

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.110
where all this money and these treasures
you're moving

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.880
came from.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.150
I earned them!

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.710
I'm at least a city lord.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.770
This is just my small savings.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.510
Is that not allowed?

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:00.510
Stop pretending!

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:01.630
Fine!

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:02.590
I'll tell you!

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.480
I killed them.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.510
I'm the one
who killed those over 100 people

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.710
in the Hao Residence.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.010
I killed them all.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.710
It was my doing.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.070
Then why

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.730
did you try to frame Tang Lici?

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.590
You're still denying it
when death is near!

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.880
No.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.950
I never intended to frame Tang Lici.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.040
It wasn't me.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.500
It was that person.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.140
He forced me to do it.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:30.930
It was him.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.620
That black-clad pipa player!

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.100
What black-clad pipa player?

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:35.840
When?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:36.710
Where?

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.260
He's not human.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.280
He's a ghost.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.140
That night,

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.290
when I left the Hao Residence,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.440
I was full of regret and fear.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.880
You poisoned everyone in the residence

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.340
and betrayed their trust.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.230
Well done.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.570
A miserable death
is the reward you deserve.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:17.430
Don't kill me!

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.510
I'll give you

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.940
whatever you want!

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.350
Please don't kill me!

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.360
You poisoned

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.300
over 100 people in the Hao Residence.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.410
They should have died in utter misery,

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.960
but I killed them
with the Sound Killing Technique,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.000
letting them die

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.400
in beautiful illusions.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.110
If you want to keep your position
as city lord,

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.670
take
the Central Plains Sword Alliance people

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.140
to the old temple outside the city

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.980
to find me.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.320
Remember my face.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.910
This is your only chance to survive.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.480
It was him.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.770
It was Tang Lici.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.080
It was Tang Lici!

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.710
You said

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.560
the murderer was your enemy.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.270
But if what you said is true—

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.050
that he framed you like this—

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.150
why didn't you take revenge on him,

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.070
eye for an eye?

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:14.240
Or perhaps,

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.510
he's not your enemy,

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.880
but...

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.800
He is my enemy,

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.250
and was once my friend.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.480
Forgive my boldness,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.440
but what kind of friend

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.550
was he?

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.370
What kind of friend?

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360
What's the rush?

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.750
We haven't seen each other for so long.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.190
I hope you haven't forgotten

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.190
all those memories we shared.
