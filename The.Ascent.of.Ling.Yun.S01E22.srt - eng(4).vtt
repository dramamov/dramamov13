=Episode 22=

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.808
(Seeking Death's Release?
It's Not That Easy!)

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.040
Who are you?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.320
Don't touch me!

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Don't touch me!

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.080
Restrain her hands.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.720
Chief Physician Zhang,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.680
I want to know

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.120
what Consort Wan's ailment is.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.360
Your Majesty,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.600
Consort Wan's pulse
is forceless to the touch

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.520
and hollow if pressed.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.840
This suggests
extended use of unknown medications

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.000
nearly depleting her vital energy.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.920
Hence these pulse manifestations.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.440
What exactly happened?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.440
What unknown medications
has she been taking?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.400
Tong An,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.280
search her palace.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.152
At once.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.800
Greetings, Your Majesty
and Your Highnesses.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.240
Your Majesty,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.880
I know what caused
Her Highness Consort Wan's madness.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.984
Her Highness isn't taking any medicine.

00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:18.848
Rather,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.640
she's practicing forbidden blood art.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.840
She baths in human blood

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.040
to vainly pursue immortality

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
and eternal youth.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.040
Forbidden blood art?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.800
To restore her beauty

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.240
and regain Your Majesty's favor,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.120
Consort Wan
requires daily blood from maids

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.280
for her blood baths.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.840
Two maids already

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.240
were bled dry and died horribly.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.880
Please see clearly.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.000
We beg Your Majesty to save our lives.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.880
Do you know the penalty
for slandering a consort?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.040
Where's your proof?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.144
What Ling Zhu said

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.000
is true?

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.464
Heh.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:01:59.880
Ling Zhu,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.720
serving my bath with your blood

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.160
is your greatest honor.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.280
Your greatest honor!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.240
Your Majesty, we found this
in Consort Wan's bathing chamber.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.592
Heed my decree.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.440
Consort Wan has doomed the harem

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.840
and slaughtered innocents.

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:27.120
She's stripped of

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.240
her title and rank

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.520
and cast to Cold Palace,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.680
never to be pardoned!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.072
Your Majesty,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.640
I have more to report.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.040
Speak.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.160
I've discovered that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.440
though claimed
as the Zhaos' eldest daughter,

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:42.656
in truth,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.040
Consort Wan was a Yangzhou courtesan
adopted by them.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.920
They deceived the court

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.240
to plant her in the palace.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.080
It's said

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.240
the forbidden art of blood-bathing youth

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.440
is secret knowledge
of Yangzhou courtesans.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.496
Where's your proof?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.200
Your Majesty,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.056
here's the contract

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.840
from when Zhao Wansong purchased

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240
Liu Yanluo, the top courtesan

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.520
of Cuiying House,
also known as Zhao Yanwan today.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.800
How audacious the Zhao family is!

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.424
Heed my decree:

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.608
Zhao Wansong

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.840
is guilty of deceiving me

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.040
and is unforgivable!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.000
Stripped of military rank,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.840
he's now a commoner

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
with assets confiscated

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.000
and clan exiled to Ningguta.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.360
As for Noble Lady Yun,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.120
for exposing this deception,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.400
she shall be promoted

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.120
to Concubine Yun.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.840
I shall remain ever prudent

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.920
and worthy of your favor.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.560
Your Majesty,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.480
I'm no Yangzhou courtesan.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.840
I'm not a Yangzhou courtesan!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.600
I'm Consort Wan!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.240
Your Consort Wan,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.360
Your Majesty!

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.080
Didn't you once
adore my unparalleled beauty?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.080
Don't believe that wretch Ling Yun.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.200
Don't believe that wretch Ling Yun!

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.120
Her slanders mean nothing, Your Majesty!

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.720
Your Majesty!

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.520
You Zhao sisters
monopolized imperial favor.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.120
Now see how you've become.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.240
How desolate it all is.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.616
Consort Jing,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.080
even if I've fallen from favor,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.360
your gloating isn't warranted.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.240
You're merely
His Majesty's deposed empress.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.240
What right have you to mock me?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.640
I've devoted myself
to fasting and Buddhist prayers

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.840
and abandoned my longing for favor.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.680
Yet Concubine Yun proves formidable.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.240
She unearthed evidence
from over a decade past.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.840
She destroyed not only you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.760
but also General Zhao
and the entire Zhao clan.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.440
She's truly cunning in mind

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.480
and boundless in schemes.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.440
That wretch Ling Yun

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.240
opposes me at every turn.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.480
I want to tear her limb from limb

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.800
and cut her into pieces!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.840
Pity,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.520
you're confined to the Cold Palace,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.880
never to leave again.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.240
Every soul has vulnerabilities.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.760
Want to counter Concubine Yun?

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.600
Lean in close.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.840
I'll share a secret.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.200
Are you here to gloat over me?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.112
You've triumphed.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.920
You're now His Majesty's
most favored woman.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.640
His Majesty's favor

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.240
means everything to you.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.856
But to me,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.640
it means nothing.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.960
Then why orchestrate all this?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.640
Once you were Consort Wan,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.920
aloft in supremacy,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.960
wielding boundless power,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.640
never bothering to look down.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.640
Now you're Zhao Yanwan.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.680
Still blind to my identity?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.696
Who are you?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.080
I've never met you before.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.760
Do you recall

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.640
Bi Jiangchen and his wife?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.800
Bi Jiangchen?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.960
Do you recall now?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.240
That's right.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.584
Bi Jiangchen

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.520
was the External Procurement Office
official you murdered.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.000
He recognized you
as a Yangzhou courtesan,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.880
so you framed him with false charges

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.320
and slaughtered his entire family.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.120
And I

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720
am his daughter who barely escaped

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.120
that massacre!

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.240
So it's you.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.040
All this is your retribution.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.360
I was orphaned,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.560
and my brother vanished.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.520
For twelve years,
I've hidden my identity.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.200
You know nothing of my suffering!

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.840
Each day I lived in terror.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.240
Every moment, I craved
to crush your bones

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.320
and flay your skin!

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.640
At last I entered the palace

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.440
and brought you down!

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.120
All this talk

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.648
changes nothing.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.440
Kill me now.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.640
Seeking death's release?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.320
It's not that easy.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.680
Don't you want news of your brother?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.016
What did you say?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.640
My brother lives?

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.720
Where is he?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.920
Tell me where he is!

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.240
Beyond the horizon,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.960
yet before your eyes.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.840
He's within these palace walls.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
But you'll never know

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.640
his true identity!

00:09:30.163 --> 00:09:32.416
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.648
(Qinglu Hall)

00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:44.384
My lord,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.600
I beg urgent assistance.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.440
What matter requires me?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.280
Help me find someone.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.440
My brother, Bi Da.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.680
Your Highness jests,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.240
or have I drunk too much?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.960
How could your brother

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.760
be in the palace?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.192
Consort Wan said

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.640
that he's within the palace.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.080
She's an insider from the past.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.416
She must've told the truth.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.336
My lord,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.040
I must find him.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.080
Please help me find him.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.840
Each time you seek me,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440
it's for favors.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.440
Have you ever wondered

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.440
why I helped you?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.120
Because we share a common enemy.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.040
Isn't Zhao Yanwan also your enemy?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.440
As Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.640
I make no enemies.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.080
I've always performed my duties
strictly by palace rules.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.640
Consort Wan

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.640
is only your enemy.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.920
The palace has countless servants.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.640
To search for someone

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.040
without clues would be like
fishing for a needle in the ocean.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.800
Moreover, after all these years,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200
how can you be certain he's still alive?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640
What if he's long passed away?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.640
Even with the slimmest chance,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.160
I must find him.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.160
If your brother

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.600
has become someone
beyond your recognition,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.000
would you still accept him?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.640
No matter what he's become,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.640
I want him.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.632
Why?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.600
Because he's the only family

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.400
I have left in this world.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.920
This is the registry
of all palace servants.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.640
Your Highness may look yourself.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.520
Zhao Yanwan has been confined
to the Cold Palace.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.240
Your Highness has achieved your wish

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.560
and may rest easy now.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.320
Don't seek me again.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.568
Thank you.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.840
Your kindness

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.640
will be remembered forever.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.040
(You needn't look for him anymore.)

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.800
(He may not)

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.840
(want to see his sister.)
