Why do you always
have to take control of everything?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.310
I just want to live my own life,

This child

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.440
deserves some pity.

00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:43.160

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.000
please have the orphanage
look after him for a few days.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.320
I'll arrange for his paperwork.

A bit of liquor helps.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.040
It makes it easier to open up.

My family had an arranged marriage.

the perfect couple.)

One day, when I came home,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.230

and shoes were gone.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.440
Tomorrow is Saturday,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.560
so no one's working.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.400
I thought I'd go check
and confirm the items.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.110
I don't think

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.110
I'll have time this week.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.440
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.280
The auction will happen
next Friday anyway.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.040
And since GL Group
is one of the organizers,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.320
I already feel bad for troubling you.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.320
But Xiaolu and the others
don't know the clients that well.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.510
How about this?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.750
We split the visits into two days.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.400
Saturday and Sunday mornings.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.630
I should still have some time
in the mornings.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.960
That works.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.960
I'll reach out to the donors then.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.680
Okay. Thanks for handling this.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.740
