00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.130
Spiritual power from Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.980
Did the Emperor of Zhushui give it to you?

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980
No wonder your power surged at the tea gathering.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.930
Who are you taking me to?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.460
The Emperor of Zhushui?

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.490
So you were faking it all along!

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.380
The black lingzhi mushroom can revive your cat.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.690
I'm sure Ming Xin knows that already.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.330
Do you intend to play along?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.050
Is there anything else

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.770
in my mind that you can't read?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.210
Right, Warrior Goddess.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.100
Everything is within your calculations.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.170
Ming Xin will show himself.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.010
I want to settle the score with him

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.380
and might as well use the opportunity

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.010
to get the last piece of the Recording Mirror.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.980
Do you dare return to Yaoguang Mountain?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.380
What if Father punishes you?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.660
Punish me?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.130
Why should I be afraid of that?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.890
When I reveal the truth to everyone,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.540
who should be afraid? You or me?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.170
Now that you've fallen for the trap

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.730
let's settle our score once and for all.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.340
what I have here.

How can this be?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.220
Mu Qibai has half of the Recording Mirror.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.570
How did you get the one in my possession

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.610
that went missing?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.410
Impossible.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.450
You have the Heavenly Grief.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.890
How can you...

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.260
The Recording Mirror

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.500
will prove that you poisoned me with the Heavenly Grief

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.500
and colluded with the Emperor of Zhushui.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.780
How do you think Yaoguang Palace will punish you?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.540
Your punishment will be more important

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.850
than my identity.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.900
I hate

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.580
that I didn't kill you back then in Jixing Abyss when I had

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.810
the Blood Moon Ring that could catalyze the netherbeasts!

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.370
Do you have any idea what you did?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.850
You poisoned me so that you can be the crown prince.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.980
That's a personal agenda.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.050
But letting the netherbeasts out

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.220
will only bring suffering to the Six Realms!

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.980
You're the greatest fool ever!

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.100
So what?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.660
Ming Xian.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.490
Were you the one

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.850
who sealed the netherbeast army

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.930
alongside Ji Bozai?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.020
Ji Bozai and you fell in love?

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.780
How preposterous.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.930
You ruined the plan of the Emperor of Zhushui.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.020
Do you think

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.780
he will let you go?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.460
Your right hand is your dominant hand.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.930
Therefore,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.170
you poisoned me with your right hand.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.810
Ming Xian, what are you doing?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.370
No!

Ming Xin.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.540
You poisoned me.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.290
Because of that, my spiritual veins were damaged and I lost

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.250
in the tournament.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.410
To fulfill your selfish desire,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.980
you forsook your duty to Yaoguang Mountain

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.020
and colluded with Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.410
You summoned the blood moon

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.980
and attempted to destroy Jixing Abyss with netherbeasts.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.610

Impossible.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.700

that only the Golden Millet Dream could cure the Heavenly Grief.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.930
You can use your spiritual veins at will now,

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.930
which means you are cured.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.140
Did Ji Bozai truly have the Golden Millet Dream

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.660
and give it to you?

Considering the two hundred or so

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.290
wandering spirits given by Yaoguang Mountain recently,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.140
you will soon master

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.850
the secret technique of Zhushui,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.980
the art of illusory assassination.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.850
Fuyue,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.660
I once told you many times

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.490
that I would never become like my father or brothers.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.610
You then asked

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.170
if it was a promise to you

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.220
or to myself.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.610
But I have seen the truth now.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.020
The blood of Zhushui flows within us.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.730
Are we all that different?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.980
We all worship the deities of Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.460
Perhaps we were all cursed from the start.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.890
Only by sacrificing our souls

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.010
can we attain true heights.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.100
If that is the price

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.890
to rise above all,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.250
so be it.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.020
Whatever you have become,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.450
you are still you.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.010
I will always stay by your side.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.100
I couldn't defeat her

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.650
and she even broke one of my arms.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.010
My bone won't ever heal again.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.460

Wait.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.420
I must talk to Father before she does.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.850
The tea gathering isn't over.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.130
Why are you back so soon?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.420
Father, I rushed back

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.300
because there's something affecting the name of Yaoguang Mountain

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.300
that you must know.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.300
Whatever

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.820
could tarnish our reputation?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.060
Tell me.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.180
All of you are dismissed.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.650
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.100
What happened to your arm?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.370
I met Ming Xian during the tea gathering.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.940
He broke my arm.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.130
Ming Xian?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.460
He's still alive?

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.940
Not only is he alive,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.610
but he also betrayed Yaoguang Mountain,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.460
and sided with Jixing Abyss.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.250
Are you sure?

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.850
Absolutely.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.610
I speak the truth.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.340
Moreover,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.060
I found something even more terrifying.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.340
Ming Xian

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.340
is a girl.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.610
What do you mean?

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.420
I could hardly believe it at first

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.530
because it was just ridiculous.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.700
But I saw it with my own eyes.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.460
The warriors with me can attest to it too.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.180
Ming Xian is a girl.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.300
She got a new name, Ming Yi,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.940
and married Ji Bozai.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.010
The so-called respected Empress must have told this lie

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.820
to secure her position.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.730
She told everyone she had given birth to a son.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.890
Then, she had her daughter disguised as a man

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.890
and deceived Yaoguang Mountain for 21 years.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.420
Impossible.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.650
He is my son.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.340
He is not a girl.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.770
I do not know

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.530
what evil trick the Empress used.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.100
But Ming Xian worked with the rival realm

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.850
and lost on purpose during the Qingyun Tournament.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.940
We then became one of the lower realms.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.060
This is the truth.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.100
I see.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.250
I shall investigate thoroughly.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.010
If Jing Shu truly committed such an atrocity,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.250
I would revoke her title as the Empress.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.420
I have one more favor to ask.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.420
Father, after the tea gathering,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.340
please hold the Crown Prince Conferment Ceremony

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.180
and appoint me as the crown prince.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.700
His Majesty said yes?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.700
The conferment ceremony will be held after three days.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.370
Then,

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.340
I'll be the official crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.610
Great.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.940
Great!

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.940
Xin.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.850
Why do you look so worried?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.250
Mother.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.370
There's one more problem.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.770
I procured the Heavenly Grief from Mu Qibai.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.300
He recorded everything with the Recording Mirror.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.370
And the mirror

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.130
is in Ming Xian's possession.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.490
What?

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.420
Then...

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.010
Then you should get the mirror back from her.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.300
But Ming Xian somehow got back her spiritual veins.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.250
She's too strong for me.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.490
But the Emperor of Zhushui

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.820
suspects Ming Xian of being the descendant of the Bo clan.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.610
He asked me to capture her alive and bring her to Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.180
Assuming he is right,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.010
then Ming Yi

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.130
does not carry the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.120
[Bo's Medical Classics]

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.530
Spiritual veins destroyed by the Heavenly Grief

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.700
may only be restored by planting the Golden Millet Dream in the victim.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.010
There is no other alternative.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.730
The Heavenly Grief in me suddenly went away.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.220
The only possible explanation

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.820
is that you gave it to me.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.420
But I had no idea at all.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.650
It seems like you have dealt with Ming Xin swiftly.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.420
It is unscathed.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.820
To revive your companion beast,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.370
you need to resonate with it using your spiritual veins.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.130
It will be painful.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.220
Let me stay here with you.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.810
The black lingzhi mushroom is working.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.380
If I nurture it for a while,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.290
Twenty-Seven will return.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.730
I finally did it.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.900
What?

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.620
Won't you ask

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.700
what I did to Ming Xin?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.980
After all, he was going to be

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.570
the crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.810
If I hurt him,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.330
Jixing Abyss might be in trouble.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.330
In trouble?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.770
As in neither of us

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.090
can handle the consequences?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.330
If you kill him, I'll bring you the blade.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.250
If you spare him, I'll cover your tracks.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.660
I have the Warrior Goddess with me.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.860
What else is there to worry about?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.900
I got the Recording Mirror,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.700
but I spared Ming Xin.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.290
He's going to reveal my identity to my father.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.860
And you

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.140
already have a plan?

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.090
Yes.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.460
But

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.700
there's one important thing

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.730
I need to check with you.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.290
When did you give me the Golden Millet Dream?

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.060
♪Maybe I'm just your firefly♪

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.620
♪That's why I'm so fragile...♪

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.180
Didn't you see me

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.530
destroy the Golden Millet Dream?

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.290
How could I possibly give it to you?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.380
I undid the seal on Bo's Medical Classics.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.700
The Golden Millet Dream

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.220
is the only cure for the Heavenly Grief.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.530
You gave it to me.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.620
Like I said,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.490
I did not.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.290
In Zhangwei Mountain, you asked if I was Ming Xian.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.460
You said you'd only ask me that question one last time.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.860
So today,

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.330
I'm asking you again one last time.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.490
If you won't answer my question,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.810
I will not ask it again.

Did you enjoy the scallion pancake?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.620
You brought a scallion pancake to Zhangwei Mountain?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.860
Is it weird?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.570
I came here for you anyway.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.730
Thank you.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.460
I only realized now

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.940
that you're more important to me

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.980
than I imagined.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.900
Don't spill anything.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.090

I'd hate to see you

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.900
look at me like that.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.980
I gave you the Golden Millet Dream

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.380
for one purpose only,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.290
so that you can live.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.980
I don't want you to feel indebted to me

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.730
or that you need to do anything to repay me.

I'm a prideful woman.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.490
I will never fall for someone out of indebtedness.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.420
Yes. You and your pride.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.530
Ming Xian.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.700
You two trespassed into Yaoguang Palace

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.090
to kidnap me.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.490
What?

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.620
Are you betraying Yaoguang Mountain

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.140
and siding with Jixing Abyss now?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.940
Looking for something?

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.940
Oh, this thing from the Emperor

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.700
of Zhushui?

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.010
What do you want?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.180
Easy.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.570
It won't be for long.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.100
I can finally

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.220
use this Soul-seizing Technique on you.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.860
Are you ready?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.090
Speak.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.700
The Emperor of Zhushui gave you power

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.530
and even the compass.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.570
What did he tell you to do?

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.570
Ming Xian.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.050
Do you think you can be the crown prince

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.660
just because you have the Recording Mirror?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.250
Dream on!

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.530
You will not steal my thunder again!

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.420
Ming Xian.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.140
Only I can be the crown prince.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.860
So his greatest fear

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.810
is you?

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.420
That's my loser of a brother for you.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.380
Don't mind him.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.490
Smiling? You have no right to be smug.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.250
What did the Emperor tell me to do?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.420
Listen carefully.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.460
He told me to capture you alive and bring you to Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.570
You're an outsider.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.980
You don't carry

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.220
the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.290
You

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.940
are a descendant of the Bo clan!

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.980
What did you say?

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.530
The elders in Yaoguang Palace claimed

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.460
that two wandering physicians once sojourned in Yaoguang Mountain.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:28.770
One of them

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.940
fell in love and had a child with one of the local warriors.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.330
Can you guess

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.490
if it's you?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.940
The Emperor of Zhushui also said

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.140
that since you could enter the Zhulong Barrier,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.770
it meant you were the descendant of the Bo clan.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.180
Father. Mother.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.140
Look.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:58.090
The crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain can only be me!

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.490
Let me find out the truth in Yaoguang Palace.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.050
Ming Yi.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.490
Father has found out.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.700
He has erected a barrier

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.020
so that I cannot return.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.860
The barrier is now broken.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.810
Guards will arrive soon.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.090
Don't worry. I'll stand guard.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.700
No one will bother you.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:47.900
Ming Yi.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.980
I can handle it.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.570
You...

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.220
How did you come back?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.460
How could they do this to you?

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.140
They know you're a fairy.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.290
So they agreed to appoint Ming Xin as the crown prince.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.660
You shouldn't have come back.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.290
I'll take you away from this place.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.570
Your father thinks you're a traitor.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.860
Even you can't be sure that you can get out of this place

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.810
alive.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.860
And you want me to come with you?

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.330
Do you think you can escape?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.050
Master told me

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.620
that you were safe in Yaoguang Palace.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.420
Look at you now.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.810
I will bring you to safety even if it means

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.090
everyone will view me as an enemy.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.620
Just go.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.250
I will not leave with you.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.980
Your Majesty, you won't come with me

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.010
because you don't think I can bring you to safety

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.050
or because

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.380
I am not your daughter?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.250
What did you say?

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.140
Ming Xin was given the task of taking me back alive

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.660
by the Emperor of Zhushui

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.770
because the Emperor found out

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.730
that I do not carry the bloodline of Yaoguang Palace.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.770
He said I was a descendant of the Bo clan.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.810
No wonder you never called me Mother

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.220
after you barged into this place.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.050
Master She.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.460
Ming Yi wrote to me,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.810
telling me that you gave the Golden Millet Dream to her.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.980
I've never thanked anyone in my life.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.660
But I'll make an exception today.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.570
Stand upright.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.940
Stand upright.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.530
Master She.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.490
Do not return the bow.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:06.860
Rest assured.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.810
I will repay the favor.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.730
I will find the Diwu tree's core as soon as possible

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.490
and make the Golden Millet Dream for you.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.460
Thank you, Master She.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.700
No need.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.860
Ming Yi also mentioned

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.180
that Ming Xin accused her of being a descendant

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.660
of the Bo clan.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.810
Did that happen?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.140
What else did Ming Xin say?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.180
Tell us.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.050
So where did the wandering Bo physicians go?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.660
I was told one died from labor complications.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.380
And the other one was last seen

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.730
leaving Yaoguang Palace

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.420
with a newborn baby.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.620
You returned

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.770
to find the truth.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.980
If I tell you the truth,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.460
will you stop pestering me?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.770
Have you ever wondered

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.090
why I have treated you so

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.010
ever since you were little?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.460
You are smart.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.330
You won every Qingyun Tournament.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.220
You wouldn't even dare

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.140
to make a mistake or lose

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.010
in your training.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.700
But I never cared

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.420
what you wanted,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.420
or if you were hurt

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.050
or hungry.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.900
No mother would ever

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.660
treat her child like this.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.730
Given your intelligence,

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.330
I thought you'd have guessed it.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.140
So...

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.980
So who am I?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.940
Your father, the Emperor of Yaoguang,

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.050
and I do not love each other.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.940
He took Madam Meng in as his consort one day

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.730
and showered her with affection.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.900
Everyone in Yaoguang Palace said

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.660
that when Madam Meng gave birth

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.180
to a son with spiritual veins,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.730
she would replace me

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.620
as the Empress of Yaoguang.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.980
Therefore,

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.660
I must give birth to a son

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.460
with spiritual veins before she does.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.960
[20 Years Ago]

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.900
There, there.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.640
Good boy.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.810
Baby. My baby.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.010
Quick.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.380
Bring me my baby.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.980
My baby.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.250
Impossible. This can't be right.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.010
My son must have spiritual veins.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.920
- Who would have thought - Impossible!

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.750
This is impossible!

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.250
The son whom I toiled so much to conceive

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.250
was born without spiritual veins?

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.290
Without spiritual veins?

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.700
Yes. The irony of it.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.140
God took pity on me and gave me a son.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.330
But in everyone's eyes,

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.180
he's just a useless person with no spiritual veins.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.050
He can never be a crown prince.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.090
He won't even be able to survive.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.380
So

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.730
who am I?

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.090
The serendipitous but hapless victim

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.770
of this tragedy.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.220
Coincidentally,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.180
another baby was born

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.570
at the same time in Yaoguang Palace.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.290
It was a baby girl

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.570
yet she was born with strong spiritual veins.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.730
So I made the decision.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.330
To save my son,

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.010
I took you, who were born on the same day, away

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.530
to replace my son.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.700
Your Majesty, I'm begging you.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.090
Yucen is already dead.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.940
This is her only child.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.660
Bo Yulan, you know very well

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.530
why your sister died from birth complications.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.380
She was hunted down by Zhushui Spiritual State

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.380
and was gravely injured.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.900
She was too weak to carry a baby,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.220
yet she risked everything to deliver her baby

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.010
for the sake of love.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.570
And her lover

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.050
couldn't do anything to protect her baby.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.900
He is a warrior

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.460
but he consummated with a foreign fairy.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.570
He is now imprisoned.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.530
I felt bad for Yucen,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.980
so I snuck her into the palace for her delivery.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.340
Now that Yucen is gone,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.300
do you think you can protect the baby?

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.460
This baby was born with unrivaled

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.090
spiritual veins and potentials.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.820
She is destined to rise above all.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.490
I know

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.170
your clan has something called the Veil of Illusion

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.300
that can conceal her gender.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.090
You and your sister

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.940
used that technique to evade the manhunt

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.610
in Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.940
Tell me how to use the technique

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.170
and I'll release your sister's lover.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.690
This baby

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.900
will be the respected crown prince of Yaoguang Mountain.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:32.650
I will make her the ruler of Six Realms.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.690
So,

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.380
I really am...

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.900
Yes, the daughter of Bo Yucen,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.940
the descendant of the Bo clan.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.420
Then, my father is...?

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.420
Master She.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.740
I heard

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.210
that the ancestors of the Bo clan would leave behind portraits.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.300
As long as someone pays respect to the portraits,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.260
their divine consciousness

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.980
will remain in the Bo clan's ancestral home.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.170
That day, in Zhangwei Mountain,

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.940
Ming Yi

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.650
saw another fairy from the Bo clan,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.860
Bo Yucen.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.780
She saw Yucen?

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.420
She truly saw Yucen?

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.820
So, you do know Bo Yucen.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.490
Fairy Bo Yucen

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.610
said something weird to Ming Yi.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.490
What did she say?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.650
The Bo clan still has one descendant in this world.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.740
And that's my child.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.860
But I hope

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.650
no one will ever find out

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.210
about her identity

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.860
or whereabouts.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.610
Oh, my baby.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.530
Never have I ever imagined

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.570
that I would be able to see you again.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.820
Ming Yi

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.940
didn't know what she meant.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.260
But...

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.420
Master She, you must know.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.300
I thought

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.780
that if Ming Yi could meet her,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.860
it means someone is still paying respect to her portrait.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.940
Is that you, Master She?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.260
Master She,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.260
I admit

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.530
that I once asked my companion beast to dig around your past.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.490
Ming Xian became a warrior of Yaoguang Mountain at the age of 13.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.050
And you

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.260
suddenly did everything you could

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.260
to be the venerable for Yaoguang Mountain's warrior ranks.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.260
That's because

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.170
you want to tutor the crown prince, Ming Xian.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.530
Well done!

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.570
Greetings, Venerable.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.380
Your Highness.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.170
No need to bow to me, Venerable.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.300
I am now one of the warriors.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.780
I should bow to you instead.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.130
Your Highness,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.530
your form was excellent just now.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.340
Perhaps you shouldn't call me Venerable.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.460
Let me be your master.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.980
I'll take you in as my disciple.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.780
You?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.780
Why should I be your disciple?

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.090
What can you teach me?

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.820
Prideful, aren't you?

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.530
Let's have a match then.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.050
If I win,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.690
you'll have to call me Master.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.650
Sure.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.380
After Ming Xin

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.980
confessed,

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.530
you began to suspect me, didn't you?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.610
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:55.980
All I'm after is the truth.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.490
Will you tell me the truth, Master She?

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.460
Were you in love

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.300
with Fairy Bo Yucen?

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.490
Your father

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.420
was the warrior

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:20.130
of Yaoguang Mountain, She Tianlin.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.530
So in the Bo clan's ancestral home, I met

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.050
my mother.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.980
The one I've known since I was little,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.010
the one who has been staying by my side,

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.170
the one whom I call Master is...

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.490
So Ming Yi

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.340
is your child with Fairy Bo Yucen.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.010
When Yucen went into labor,

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.940
I was imprisoned by the Empress.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.490
When I was released,

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:34.530
Yucen had already passed

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.980
from birth complications.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.170
I couldn't even look at her one last time.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:53.900
By then,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.740
your daughter

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.460
had already become the son of the Empress.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.210
I was at my wits' end.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.090
I had no other option.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.010
What can I do?

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.650
I was just an ordinary warrior

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.300
and they were the entire Yaoguang Palace.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.050
Could I fight them all?

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.610
Could I fight the Empress?

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.650
I could only endure it silently.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.860
Yucen's portrait

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.090
contains our shared memories.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.050
For 21 years,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.860
for all 21 years,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.380
those cherished past memories,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.530
and Ming Yi's future

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:48.650
have kept me alive.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.900
For 21 years,

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.980
have you never intended

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.420
to tell Ming Yi the truth?

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.210
You would rather Ming Yi live

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.380
in deception forever?
