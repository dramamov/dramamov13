00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280
Excuse me, is the auction
on the second floor?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.240
Yes. This way, please.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.030
Thank you.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.800
Lu Xingchen sure knows how to slack off.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.911
We've been busy all day
and haven't seen him at all.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:12.239
Shut up.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.080
Don't you know
they've been fighting lately?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.670
Ms. Gu isn't in a good mood these days.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.830
- Behave.
- Okay.

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:19.488
I heard they had a huge fight
the day I went on a business trip.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.670
That's enough.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.360
Are you gossiping during work hours?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.160
Ms. Gu.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.360
I told you to stop.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.720
You were so loud.

00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:41.160
How's the preparation going?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.080
Almost done.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.310
Why is Lin Xiang here?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.470
Mr. Xingchen invited him over
under Xinghan's name.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.750
Hello, Ms. Gu.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.080
How have you been, Mr. Lin?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.270
What a nice auction you've organized.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.470
Welcome. Please come in.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.600
Who knows she really means that.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.240
Are you okay?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.710
Yes, I'm good.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.550
Let's go. It's about to start.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.920
Sure.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.670
Distinguished guests,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.270
(Starlight Charity Auction)
welcome to the GL charity auction.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.200
Let's first invite our organizer,
Ms. Gu Liusu,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.390
to give a speech.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.990
A round of applause, please.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Liusu.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.760
Thank you all for taking time out

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.670
of your busy schedules to join us.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520
The reason this auction is held

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.670
is that I myself grew up
in an orphanage.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.110
I hope that through this event,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.711
we can raise more funds
for the orphanage

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:56.270
to improve the children's
living and educational conditions

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.520
to the greatest extent possible.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.390
Before the auction starts,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.360
I'd like to make an announcement.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.590
Starry Sea will be rebranded
as the Ruin Revival series.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.360
Also, we'll recycle shell casings
from war zones

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.320
to replace metal ornaments from before.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.430
Ostentatious.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.390
Twenty percent of the proceeds
will be donated to charity.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.040
- That's good.
- Great.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.110
Right.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.430
Thank you so much.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.480
Let's look at our first item.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.590
(Title: Elegant Grace)

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.220
This painting was made
by a child from the orphanage.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.360
The starting price is 20,000 yuan.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.150

Bidder 10, 250,000.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.800
You failed to drug Gu Liusu

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.040
and smeared GL too.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.760
If you fail this time as well,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.240
you can jog on.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.990

Xinghan's item costs,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.200
you must get it.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.830
Why?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.870
The Lu family invited us here.

00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.511
What do you think that means?

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.270
Bidder 3, 280,000.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.880
Those two must've broken up.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.230
We should take this chance

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.466
to get on Xinghan's good side.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.080

Next is our second item.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.830

Ladies, let's go check it out.

You stay here and enjoy the drama.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.200
I'm heading off.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.000
What's going on?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
- Ms. Gu, would you explain this photo?
- Xiaolu, close it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.400
Are you two dating? Is your whole
strong-woman thing just a persona?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.560
Is GL going bankrupt?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.470
What's going on?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.230
Something's wrong.

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:29.640
Why can't I click anything?

00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:31.880
Ms. Gu, did you seduce your way up
to Mr. Xingchen?

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:32.150
No.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.800
You won over a rich heir
who's nine years younger.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.950
Do you have any tips on seduction?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.910
It's not like that.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.780
Back up, please. Back up.
Stop taking photos!

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.710
It's not true.

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:40.422
I was the one who seduced her.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.640
Enough.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.560
If you have any questions, ask me.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.177
Don't make things hard for Gu Liusu.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.390
I was the one
who approached her on purpose.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.270
If you want to know

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.270
seduction tricks,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.790
I'll share everything

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.640
I know.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.230
Reporters,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320
please calm down.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.520
Gu Liusu.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.180
- Mr. Xingchen.
- Mr. Xingchen.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.790
As for our relationship,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.470
I'm pursuing Ms. Gu.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.440
I see.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.520
Alright.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.590
Let's turn our focus back

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.520
to the charity auction.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.680
Next up

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.270
is Xinghan's donation.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.200
Bring it in.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.900
- I'd like to see what it is.
- I'll take a look.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.222
Xinghan must've donated
something valuable.

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:47.760
You won't know. Let's see.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.560
Let's unveil it.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.270
This is...

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.266
Isn't this a diamond candy?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.790
What's Lu Xingchen doing?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.270
Who'd bid on a diamond candy?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.910
Take photos. Quick.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.644
This'll be tomorrow's headline.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.520
Ms. Gu.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.030
It's a diamond candy.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.000
Diamond candy?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.790
Is he hyping it up?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.080
The kind you buy for a few yuan
at a general store.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.520
Lu Xingchen,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.270
do you even know what you're doing?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.440
Trust me.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.440
Hello, Mo Li?

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.560
Can we invite Lin Xiang
under Xinghan's name tomorrow?

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.560
Didn't you object to that before?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.880
Don't ask. Just do it.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.960
I have my plans.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.120
Alright.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.000
Good.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.960
The starting price is

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.520
one million.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.390
- One million?
- What?

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.080
Is he out of his mind?
One million for a candy?

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.000
Anyone wants to bid?

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.320
Who could afford that?

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.230
No one's bidding.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.590
No matter how much

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.830
Xinghan's item costs,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.590
you must get it.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.470
Xinyi Group.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.440
One million.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.910
Xinyi bid for it. What a fool.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.270
Let's go.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.880
Please accept our interview.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.680
(He invited Xinyi and brought a candy.)

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.760
(Is this payback for me?)

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.910
Any higher bids?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.030
One million once.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.230
One million twice.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.870
One million three times. Sold.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.680
This is going to cause trouble.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.960
But a voluntary donation
doesn't break any rules.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.110
Wrap up everything for today.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.830
About this auction,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.920
I hope you'll write positively

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.710
in your reports.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.920
Also, many thanks to Ms. Gu
for organizing this auction

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.560
and giving us charity people a chance.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.830
He only came back to Xinghan
to stand up for Gu Liusu.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.400
But a charity gala

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.470
is just about voluntarily donating
unused items.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.800
It doesn't matter
whether the item has value or not.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.750
Isn't the goal to do charity?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.800
How can he earn those executives'
respect that way?

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.630
He acts like a spoiled rich kid.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.350
I wonder what he learned overseas
all these years.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.110
Chivalry, maybe.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.320
Lin Xiang always abuses people

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.590
because of his wealth.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.870
Mo Li,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.110
go to Xinyi and clean up the mess
Xingchen caused yesterday.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.560
Yes.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.280
Okay.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.870
If you're free this afternoon,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.320
ask Gu Liusu out for tea.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.680
What are you planning?
Trying to stop them?

00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:02.200
I'm telling you, your son
isn't good enough for my bestie.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.230
I didn't mean that.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.230
My son has good taste

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.560
like me.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.320
But I think he might make things worse
even if he means well.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.040
Nice one, bro.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.590
You saved a damsel in distress.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.160
That's called diversion.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.350
Lin Xiang won't miss the chance

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.470
to butter up Xinghan.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.710
Bro, you're smart.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.350
If I were Ms. Gu, I'd be so touched.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.320
Let me check
if she replies to my message.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.920
Don't go. Let's have another drink.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.750
Mr. Lin,

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.320
let's talk about the auction payment.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.400
What?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.440
The father is cleaning up
his son's mess?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.830
He thinks Xinyi can't afford a million?

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.560
How about we discuss this privately?

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.200
Give us the room.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.160
Mr. Mo.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.750
There are outsiders,
so I was just pretending.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.560
Have you had enough of the good life

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.680
and wanted to go to jail?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.733
Did you take the photo at the auction?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.160
I...

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.960
Answer me!

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.830
Cat got your tongue?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.800
No.... Why so worked up?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.280
I told you not to mess with Gu Liusu.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.510
Don't you understand?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.080
You hate Lu Xingchen, don't you?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.990
She's Lu Xingchen's woman!

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.800
Lu Xingchen's woman?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.830
Who told you that?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.680
Mr. Lin,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.830
are you that eager to buy GL?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.230
Well, well.

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:31.800
Don't you fear being choked
by your own greed?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.960
You know I have enough evidence
to put you behind bars, don't you?

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.555
Be an obedient dog
if you don't want to go in.

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:01.510
Why are you siding with Gu Liusu?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.400
Are you still eating?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.470
Well...

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.590
Don't be nervous.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.560
Let's talk about the auction.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.710
Sure.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.400
Have a drink.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.110
Let the auction matter pass.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.560
I don't get

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.680
why you keep cleaning up
Lu Xingchen's mess.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.960
I told you to watch my son.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.750
Is this how you do it?

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.630
(Because someone asked me
to look after him.)

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.180
