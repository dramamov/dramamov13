They begged me to keep it a secret.

Yes, that's right.

It's the lunchtime rush.
Can I let someone join you?

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:38.783
[chuckles] You over there.
Come sit over here.

00:19:38.866 --> 00:19:40.117

00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:47.124

I'm Meri's friend, Park Gyeonghwa.

00:20:03.557 --> 00:20:06.310
Oh, I heard a lot about you.

00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:07.686
Her army friend.

00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:10.022
When did you tell him about me?

00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:11.816
[both chuckle softly]

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:13.359

00:20:13.943 --> 00:20:15.277
-Was that weird?
-Yes.

-How do you know of this place?

00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:23.077
It's a hidden gem
only a few people know about.

00:20:24.203 --> 00:20:28.207
My boss from when I worked in New York
knew this place.

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:32.127
He loved Pyongyang naengmyeon
and often mentioned this place.

-Yes, thanks. [chuckles]

Your smile. It reminds me of him.

His head shape was petite and pretty,
just like yours.

00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:14.628
It looked so nice when shaved.

00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:16.213

He shaved his head to move into a temple,

00:21:24.096 --> 00:21:26.348
and I cut mine short to join the army.

00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:28.517
We shared a farewell drink right here.

00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:30.102
With a small plate of boiled pork.

[exclaims in realization]

00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:33.355
That must've broken your heart.

Such is life. It can get salty with tears.

Oh, sure.

Pretend he's out there doing just fine.

You can say that
about your boy, Occipital.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:54.543
There's a boy we call Occipital.
Her elementary school first love.

-The same guy.
-[Gyeonghwa] Oh, really?

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:04.470
Anyway, she gave him her favorite toy,

00:22:04.553 --> 00:22:06.889
but he rejected her without a thank-you.

00:22:07.556 --> 00:22:08.599
-A toy?
-Yes.

00:22:08.682 --> 00:22:12.561
She gave it to him out of pity
because he was shaking after a car crash.

00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:16.148
Ever since, she's been giving,
and everyone takes advantage of her.

So, that's why...

00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:27.576
He's called Occipital
because he had a cute head.

00:22:28.494 --> 00:22:30.120
It was very spherical.

00:22:30.663 --> 00:22:33.123

Yeosu's pretty small.
You'd have crossed paths once.

00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:46.845
He wasn't from there, I guess.

No?

00:22:49.014 --> 00:22:50.391

No.

If we were to meet again,
I'd recognize him right away.

He was so good-looking.

He was totally my type.

00:23:07.616 --> 00:23:10.119
I bet he grew up to be just as handsome.

-It's a souvenir I got

from today's defense seminar.

00:23:44.737 --> 00:23:47.031

you wailed so hard
that you got snot and tears all over me.

It was an expensive shirt, too.

00:29:52.813 --> 00:29:55.357
We only dated for less than a month.

00:29:56.608 --> 00:29:58.068
I was young and immature.

that I ruined my finals.

That's why she won't tell you

There's no need to look very far.

The person could be under your nose.

the back of my head looked pretty.

Why didn't you look for her?

Why would he go back there

when the couple's already dead?

00:56:36.081 --> 00:56:37.165
[chuckles softly]

00:56:37.582 --> 00:56:38.583
The soup is salty.

00:56:40.127 --> 00:56:43.088
I should've tasted it
once more at the end.

00:56:43.171 --> 00:56:44.631
That's fine. I'll water it down now.

00:56:47.718 --> 00:56:48.760
[Kim Wooju chuckles]

00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:51.847
[hums in satisfaction, gulps]

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.432
-It's perfect.
-[chuckles softly]

00:56:55.517 --> 00:56:57.894
I'm sure you had more than enough at home.

00:56:57.978 --> 00:57:00.731
Don't eat that. Have something else.

00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:01.815
Some japchae.

00:57:02.357 --> 00:57:04.067
-[Kim Wooju acknowledges]
-That should be fine.

00:57:05.736 --> 00:57:08.655
The braised short ribs are great.
Have some meat, too.

00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:12.159
[♪ whimsical sting]

00:57:16.788 --> 00:57:18.665
Ms. Yoo, why do you treat me like this?

00:57:19.666 --> 00:57:20.667
What?

00:57:21.209 --> 00:57:23.044
Why would you cook all this for me?

00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:26.214
Even my family
doesn't care about my birthday.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.051
[hesitates]

00:57:30.135 --> 00:57:32.095
I didn't know about that.

00:57:32.846 --> 00:57:33.972
[exhales]

00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:36.600
I haven't had seaweed soup in so long.

00:57:37.726 --> 00:57:39.936
[sharp inhale] Was it when I was eight?

00:57:40.687 --> 00:57:42.355
I think that was the last time.

00:57:43.815 --> 00:57:44.816
I felt like

00:57:45.567 --> 00:57:47.110
I shouldn't eat birthday soup.

00:57:49.988 --> 00:57:52.783
My parents passed away on my birthday,

00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:54.743
and it was my fault.

00:57:55.243 --> 00:57:56.745
[♪ ominous sting]

00:57:56.828 --> 00:57:59.539
So, instead of having seaweed soup,

00:57:59.623 --> 00:58:01.041
I stuffed my face with rice.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:04.085
Eating lots of rice made me sleepy,

00:58:04.169 --> 00:58:05.337
so I could just sleep.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.880
[♪ soft, gentle music playing]

00:58:06.963 --> 00:58:08.048
When I woke up,

00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:09.591
it would be the next day.

00:58:13.178 --> 00:58:15.305
That's what I've done to forget that day.

00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:19.392
That's why

00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:23.021
it feels weird when I see people
who look forward to their birthday.

00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:26.983
It feels awkward when someone

00:58:27.943 --> 00:58:29.110
wishes me a happy birthday.

00:58:32.113 --> 00:58:34.074
Thanks for celebrating with me, though.

00:58:36.868 --> 00:58:37.994
[chuckles softly]

00:58:41.206 --> 00:58:42.833
[hums in satisfaction, slurps]

00:58:47.796 --> 00:58:48.797
Good for you.

00:58:51.007 --> 00:58:52.133
For sleeping the whole day.

00:58:52.759 --> 00:58:53.760
Good for you.

00:58:55.387 --> 00:58:57.806
There are 365 days in a year.

00:58:57.889 --> 00:59:00.350
It doesn't matter
if you erase one from your mind.

00:59:00.892 --> 00:59:04.020
When things get too tough,
it's best to just run away.

00:59:04.312 --> 00:59:05.397
[♪ upbeat pop music playing]

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.148
Let's eat a lot

00:59:07.983 --> 00:59:09.150
and save up our energy.

00:59:10.402 --> 00:59:11.403
Okay.

00:59:18.827 --> 00:59:19.995
[Kim Wooju hums in satisfaction]

00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.079
Oh, right.

00:59:22.247 --> 00:59:23.832
-[chuckling]
-It's so terribly salty.

00:59:33.466 --> 00:59:34.634
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

00:59:36.177 --> 00:59:37.178
Right here...

00:59:37.554 --> 00:59:38.555
No.

00:59:39.055 --> 00:59:40.181
Let me...

00:59:46.146 --> 00:59:47.272
[♪ ethereal sparkle]

00:59:53.737 --> 00:59:54.863
[clears throat]

00:59:56.907 --> 00:59:58.116
When did that happen?

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:07.876
Hey.

01:00:16.009 --> 01:00:17.594
It's a double rainbow.

01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:18.678
Mr. Kim.

01:00:18.887 --> 01:00:20.013
[♪ enchanting music playing]

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:21.139
Hurry.

01:00:27.103 --> 01:00:28.188
[exclaims in awe]

01:00:37.072 --> 01:00:38.073
No way.

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:43.870
[exclaims in awe]

01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:45.956
Quick, make a wish.

01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:47.707
-What?
-What?

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:50.251
Don't you know
the three best times to make a wish?

01:00:50.335 --> 01:00:52.754
When the first snow falls,
as you hold your breath in a tunnel,

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:54.172
and to a double rainbow.

01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:55.799
Those wishes come true.

01:00:55.882 --> 01:00:57.092
[scoffing]

01:00:57.175 --> 01:00:59.094
Says who? Who even believes that?

01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:09.646
[♪ enchanting music continues]

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:20.031
-What did you wish for?
-What about you?

01:01:21.408 --> 01:01:23.451
I wished that everything would work out.

01:01:23.535 --> 01:01:25.286
That I'd make lots of money,

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.830
and that my mom wouldn't get sick.

01:01:26.913 --> 01:01:30.208
I want my career to take off
and no one to find out about the house.

01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:32.585
-Wow, you ask for a lot.
-What did you wish for?

01:01:32.669 --> 01:01:34.004
[hums thoughtfully]

01:01:35.005 --> 01:01:36.006
[clears throat]

01:01:36.423 --> 01:01:37.966
Hey, come on.

01:01:38.049 --> 01:01:39.050
You won't tell?

01:01:39.134 --> 01:01:40.593
[♪ whimsical music playing]

01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:41.720
I don't remember.

01:01:41.803 --> 01:01:43.054
You don't remember?

01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:44.806
Tell me. I want to know.

01:01:44.889 --> 01:01:46.474
Oh, I don't remember.

01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:48.727
You agreed to tell me.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.812
-When did I say that?
-That didn't work.

01:01:51.938 --> 01:01:54.065
That's not fair. I told you my wishes.

01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:56.651
-Don't ask.
-Then spit out the food you just ate.

01:01:57.652 --> 01:01:58.945
[imitates retching]

01:02:01.114 --> 01:02:03.950
[Kim Wooju] In that short moment,
I made a wish.

01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:06.119
That the wishes of the woman

01:02:06.828 --> 01:02:10.915
who gave me a way out whenever I was
at a dead end would come true.

01:02:29.893 --> 01:02:31.019
Okay, then.

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:32.896
Tell me if I catch you.

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:35.440
[♪ dramatic sting]

[♪ upbeat dreamy music playing]

01:03:58.523 --> 01:04:01.192
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

01:04:01.276 --> 01:04:03.027
[Kim Wooju] Didn't you say
he was in Hong Kong?

01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:04.654
[Meri] Do you think
he came here knowingly?

01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:06.281
[Jingyeong] Thank you for that day.

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:09.075
[Meri] I want to be with someone
who's there for me when I'm struggling.

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:10.827
[Sejung] What's this? What do we do?

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:11.995
[Kim Wooju] We should go.

01:04:12.078 --> 01:04:13.329
[Wooju] ...lives at Beauté Palace.

01:04:13.413 --> 01:04:16.207
I went there for something
and saw someone who looked just like you.

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.750
[Meri] You must've been mistaken.

01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:18.835
Where will you sleep, then?

01:04:18.918 --> 01:04:19.961
That room...

01:04:20.044 --> 01:04:21.754
-[Kim Wooju] I'll sleep here.
-[Meri] What?

01:04:21.838 --> 01:04:23.256
[Jingyeong] Back out of it right now.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:25.175
What if your grandmother finds out?

01:04:25.258 --> 01:04:27.260
This makes you an accomplice.

01:04:28.344 --> 01:04:29.470
[Wooju] Did you have fun

01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:31.181
living your fake newlywed life?
