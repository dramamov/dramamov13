(The Supreme Priest's Secret)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.839
A little more to the left.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.839
More to the left.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.479
Great.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.719
A bit closer.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.840
A little closer.

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.799
Ready.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.960
Three.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.039
Two.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.439
One.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:40.600
Wait a second.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.039
What's wrong?

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.600
Those stories say

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:46.840
that taking a photo

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.640
might capture
the soul of the Lord of Wujian.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.000
What if...

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.320
You actually believe those stories?

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.640
The only one who can take his soul

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.399
is his bride.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.820
Let's get on with it.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.000
Sure.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.039
Three.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:04.439
Two.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.599
Wait.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.000
I...

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.319
What now?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.120
My makeup

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.280
is a bit different than usual.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.640
I'm not sure which one looks better.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.079
So the famous Miss Lu

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.640
can actually get shy.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.680
I care about it

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.879
because it's our first photo together.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.599
You look best today.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:30.840
Come on.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.439
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:33.519
We might not

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:35.120
be able to shoot today.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.120
This camera

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.840
is acting up.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.079
Look over there.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.200
Here we go.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.240
I don't know what's wrong today.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.840
I just can't get my eyebrows right.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.199
How about I, the culprit, give it a try?

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.599
You actually know how to draw eyebrows?

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.000
You must have done it
for other girls before.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.800
That's why you're so good at it.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.800
You're the first person
I've ever drawn eyebrows for.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.120
And I'd do it for you all my life.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.639
Stay still.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:23.680
You're gorgeous, darling.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.240
(Yan.)

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.199
(A hundred years ago, you were heartbroken
because of me.)

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.879
(And on the Bridge of Nine Souls,
you risked your life for me.)

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.399
(As the ruler of Wujian,)

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.399
(I will never let you be hurt again.)

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.120
I'm getting hungry.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.680
Go make me something to eat.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.040
Sure.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.639
Miss Gu.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.439
It's time for work, isn't it?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.319
I quit.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.279
It's me, You Zimei.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.120
Miss You.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.439
Miss Lu.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.279
There's something I'd like
to speak to you about privately.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.199
Can you come see me tomorrow?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.759
I asked you here today

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.680
because I want this conversation

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.560
to stay between us.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.879
You once told me

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.439
about the Bodhi Fruit.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.450
I haven't forgotten that favor.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.240
So don't stand on ceremony.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.399
I may have told you
about the Bodhi Fruit,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.399
but it was I who restored
the Soul-Eating Sword.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.600
Thus,

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.959
it can hardly be called a favor.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.560
Everything I've done

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.040
is for the Wujian.

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:59.800
Then why did you

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.639
ask to see me?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.240
I was born of the Wujian,

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.759
so I can't turn my back on it.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.399
Your bond with him

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:08.360
is doomed to end in tragedy.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.040
If the Mei pearl stays within you,

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.040
he can't return to Wujian.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.199
Not only will he die,

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.079
but the Wujian will perish as well.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:21.720
A hundred years ago,

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.879
the First Master fell in love
with a human woman.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
They had a child

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.399
who was half-human by blood.

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.839
He could not remain
in the Wujian forever.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.879
To save him,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.240
the First Master

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.399
chose two human girls

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.360
to be the vessels
of the Chi and Mei pearls.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:37.480
Your sister

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.279
was the vessel of the Chi pearl.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.160
And you

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.600
are that of the Mei pearl.

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.560
In the face of this impossible fate,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.800
Li Motong

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.839
chose to sacrifice himself

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.040
to let you live.

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:05.240
But I believe you have the right to know

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.600
and the right to choose.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.000
I wonder

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.800
what your choice is.

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:18.079
He risked his life for me.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:21.040
I, Lu Huayan, am no coward either.

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.800
I'm willing to give up the Mei pearl

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.639
to let him live.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.959
But I have one condition.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.080
What condition?

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.159
Make him forget me.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.559
Please.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:52.799
Sure.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.159
I promise you.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:55.639
Thank you.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.720
Although you

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.039
are willing to give up the Mei pearl,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.399
the Soul-Eating Sword

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.799
is still in Li Motong's hands.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:03.879
Well,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.399
don't worry.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.159
I'll retrieve it.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.399
(Even if fate has bound us this way,)

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.799
(I refuse to accept it.)

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.559
(Li Motong.)

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.080
(I'm the bride of the Wujian.)

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.480
(I won't let you suffer for me
another hundred years.)

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.000
(Forget me.)

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.799
(Only through rebirth)

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.519
(can new life begin.)
