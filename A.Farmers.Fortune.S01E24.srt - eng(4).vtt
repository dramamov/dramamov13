General Su, please give me a little more...

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.800
General, some villagers are outside.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.000
They're demanding to see He Qingqing.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.720
What villagers?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.880
Drive them away.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.840
Yes.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.640
Qingqing, we're here!

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.720
Qingqing,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.960
if Boss Wang hadn't told us you pawned off
your belongings,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.720
we wouldn't even have known you were
in such trouble.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.120
Here, take this money.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.600
Sanniang,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.200
I can't accept this.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.920
The food shop can't reopen now.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.760
I already owe you too much.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.200
Stop.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.760
Don't talk like we're strangers.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
If it weren't for you back then,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.560
I'd have been sold off to God knows where.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.240
And you told me yourself,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.760
once I could stand on my own two feet,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.280
it'd be time to repay you.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.040
That time is now.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.800
At last, I can

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.280
rightfully become

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.760
your business partner.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.360
Miss He,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.480
this is three years' advance stipend

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.040
the academy owes to Mr. Su.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.480
He's a man of great talent.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
We can't afford to let him go.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.040
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.760
Qingqing, please don't refuse this.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.760
It's what

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.520
the villagers collected together.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.760
Altogether, twenty taels.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
They asked me to bring it to you.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.320
Aunt Zhou,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.440
you really didn't have to...

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.280
I pinch every coin till it cries,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.040
but I know

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.840
the good days we've had

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.720
are thanks to you, Qingqing.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.800
If we don't help you now,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.760
what kind of people would we be?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.600
Don't worry, Qingqing.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.560
Tell us how much more you need,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
I'll cover the rest.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.320
Consider it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
a down payment for our future partnership.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.520
Alright.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.920
Thank you, everyone.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.480
General Su,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.040
I've gathered the remaining hundred taels.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.880
Now we can finally

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.640
be reunited as a family, can't we?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400
In the end,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.840
I've lost.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.480
You've won.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.240
I expected

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.400
this outcome.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.680
So

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.280
you really refuse to be Su Yanjin?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.600
You truly refuse

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.680
to be my son?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.280
I never once thought of not being your son.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.400
But my heart belongs to the way of the scholar.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.640
I won't waver.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.560
These past days,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.680
I've come to understand

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.120
a father's care and foresight.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.120
A father's love

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.320
plans far ahead for his child.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.880
I want to be like you,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.880
to protect my wife and child just as

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.600
you protected me when I was little.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.000
Please, Father,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.920
grant me your blessing.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.800
Mom,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.480
when will Dad come out?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.720
Don't worry,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.720
he'll be out soon.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440
Okay.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.000
Qingqing.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.320
This is from Father.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.000
Grandpa,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.720
I'll come back someday to learn martial arts

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.200
from you.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.120
Sanniang.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.720
You're finally back!

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.320
Thank you so much for today.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
Don't be so formal.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.320
Look at that moon tonight,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.120
so red and bright,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.320
unlike any other night.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.440
That means peaceful days are ahead.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.440
I remember reading about

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.280
such omens.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.200
A crimson moon, falling stars,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.720
the heavens shift,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.720
and nature's law

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.480
may change.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.400
Change?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.320
(Could it be)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.400
(I'm going back?)

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.400
(So soon?)

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.920
You all enjoy your family time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.320
We'll take our leave.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.560
Let's go.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.840
Here.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.280
Sanniang,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440
in this moment,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.000
I've written you another poem.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.520
For you.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.160
Oh, your sappy words.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.080
You'll make people laugh!

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.990
Save it for when we get home.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.880
Alright.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160
What's wrong?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.320
Nothing.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.680
On such a special night,

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.440
shouldn't we celebrate a little?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.470
Sure.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.720
Careful.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.560
- I made it myself.
- Here.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.360
Try some.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.320
So sour!

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.160
Carrots!

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.600
- So sour!
- So sour!

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.890
Here, Tangbao.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320
Let's have a toast.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.770
Okay!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.920
Cheers!

Tangbao,

I want to entrust you both

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.520
with the deed to Fengyang House.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
From now on,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.320
the house should be passed down to you two.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.720
Would you be willing?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.320
I'm willing!

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.200
I want to be

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.560
just as amazing as Mom!

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.840
Our Tangbao will be even more amazing

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.800
than Mom.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.800
With talent like hers,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.560
she'll surely help

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.760
our family's house flourish again.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.760
But isn't inheriting the family business

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240
something for boys to do?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Mom, that's not right.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.760
There's no difference between boys and girls.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.560
Tangbao loves this and she's good at it,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.240
so she should be the one to take it on.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.680
Xiaosheng is right.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.880
I was mistaken.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.640
Then,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.240
Xiaosheng, what do you want to do?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.440
Say what you want to say.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.360
I...

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.560
I want to learn martial arts.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.480
Good.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760
Since you've made your choice,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.520
pursue it bravely.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.680
I hope

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.560
both of you

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.000
will always follow your hearts

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.880
and do what you truly love.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.400
So that's why

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.880
you were so determined to buy back
Fengyang House,

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.440
because it was something you truly wanted.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.840
And now,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.800
have you achieved your wish?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.680
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.760
Because

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.080
I've found something

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.880
more precious

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.560
than a dream.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.240
Mom, the stars fell!

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.200
They're shooting stars.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.400
Come on.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.140
Let's make a wish.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.140
Wishes are most powerful right now.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.940
I want to become a great general

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.300
to protect Dad, Mom and Tangbao.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.300
I want to be like Mother,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.260
and always stay together.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.860
Mom,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.140
your turn!

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.820
May those I love

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.460
never drift apart.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.940
I hope Mom's wish comes true.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.700
Me too.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.140

let me be your husband?

I will.
