[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 10]

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.130
I disagree with much

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.330
of what Changhe said,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.820
but one thing

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.690
was no empty talk:

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.460
together, the two of us

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.290
have never lost.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.850
Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.490
Activate!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.260
Great.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.730
Excellent!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.450
Eighteen-Sword Array?

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.260
The greatest regret of my life

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.100
is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.610
not being born a hundred years earlier

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.580
to face the Su family's finest,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.690
Su Shiba, in battle.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.380
Who would've thought that after I was sealed

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.200
inside a coffin,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.060
the Su family

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.060
would produce another who could revive the Eighteen-Sword Array?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.570
You're so talkative.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.540
I've been trapped in that coffin

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.690
for so many years,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.010
of course, I have much to say

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.100
and many fights yet to fight.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.060
These swords of yours aren't enough to take me down.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.340
Show me

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.410
your true strike.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.820
Then I'll grant your wish.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.690
Drizzle Sword.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.220
What's that?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.340
He's absorbing my sword energy.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.400
So

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.290
this is what makes Hell Palm so terrifying.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.780
What a fool.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.950
You've got some nerve to use your palm against me.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.710
Open your eyes wide

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.740
to see who the real fool is.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.490
Changhe.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.050
I didn't know

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.580
that besides me,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.810
there was someone in the Blood River

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.900
bold enough

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.140
to defy the rules.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.660
You've been secretly practicing the Hell Palm.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.220
Secretly?

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.730
Judging from how things turned out,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.140
I'd say I was just early to start.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.490
What a shame.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.220
If your cultivation in the Hell Palm

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.610
were one level higher,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.100
you could've beaten me.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.660
But alas.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.340
The Ten Courts of Hell

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.610
each rule over life and death.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.780
You're

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.290
one step short.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.580
Darn it.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.730
How can a man who just crawled out of a coffin

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.290
have such profound inner force?

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.040
I looked pathetic.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.540
Changhe,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.760
do you really mean to lead them

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.540
to the other shore?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.540
Of course,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.220
even though this is only the beginning.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.050
I've always been the only one

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.140
who prefers to stay away from strife.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.020
Since this is fate's will,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.850
I'll sever it with my sword.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.580
Hold the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.100
and become the first

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.900
Patriarch

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.140
as a Nameless.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.660
You finally came around.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.020
We were born

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.220
to fight our fate.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.220
If you wish to wield the sword, then let's do it.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.340
Only death

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.540
can stop us.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.810
I'll find you an opening to wield that sword.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.050
Such arrogance.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.020
Yue'an,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.580
if you only have one chance to strike,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.340
close your eyes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.140
and trust the judgment

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.460
you're most certain of in that moment.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.410
Su Muyu,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.020
I can't hold on anymore!

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.730
I'm running out of strength.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.410
That slash

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.290
damaged your heart meridian.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.100
If you keep insisting,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.140
you'll die.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.340
You two...

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.100
What were your names again?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.810
Su Muyu.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.250
I'm Su Changhe.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.170
Very good.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.610
Your names

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.220
will be known across the land.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.850
We'll meet again.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.980
Very good.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.490
You two

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.980
are indeed impressive.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.490
I'll look forward

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.220
to our next encounter.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.300
Su Muyu,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.510
if you really want to quit,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.350
the promise we made before

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.250
doesn't stand anymore.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.020
As for the powers behind all this that you mentioned,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.420
I'll root them out

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.140
in no time.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:11.980
Alright.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.850
That being said, the Hell Palm is too dangerous.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.850
One slip,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.720
and it could backfire on you.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.370
You ought to be extra careful.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.180
It's not easy

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.530
for us to have come this far.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.700
But

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.770
I'll keep moving forward.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.730
Changhe...

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.250
I know what you're going to say.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.220
I'll announce to the world,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.770
from today on,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.980
there'll be no more Umbrella Ghost in the Blood River.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.460
I'll destroy the Soul Reapers' Hall,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.100
so no one

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.340
can ever issue another writ to kill you again.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.490
As well as the family

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.340
you wish to take with you.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.650
You once said you liked Nan'an.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.410
I bought a mansion there

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.120
with the savings I stashed away over the years.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.420
Go to Nan'an and find

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.000
the owner of Shouyue Banking House.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.470
He'll give you the deed.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.420
There are ten thousand taels of silver

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.460
buried under the courtyard.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.940
If you run out of money,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.580
dig it up.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.730
Every autumn...

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.770
Every autumn,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.420
when osmanthus fills Nan'an City,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.370
I'll come find you for a drink.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.580
Of course,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.820
if you'd rather no one,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.300
including me, know where you are,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.010
you can sell the mansion back

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.730
to the Shouyue Banking House.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.060
Still,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.010
every autumn,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.580
when osmanthus fills Nan'an City,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.250
I'll hope to see you again.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.370
Changhe.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.250
You never belonged here.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.100
Leaving this place is what you were meant to do.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.300
As for me,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.850
I crawled out from piles of dead bodies when I was a child.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.770
To me, life

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.770
was never worth much.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.820
If I leave,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.820
I wouldn't even know where to go.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.980
But you're a fool, really.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.370
You hate killing,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.850
yet it's the only thing you're good at.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.250
You know nothing else.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.300
You've been the Kui for years,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.100
and you're still broke.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.730
If you lived in the mortal world,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.460
you'd definitely be cheated.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.850
Farewell.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.850
Su Muyu.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.250
You call me a fool.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.100
You're just as much of a fool.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.580
Remember we went to Luohe City

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.340
on our first mission

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.180
to kill Li Huan, the one who embezzled relief funds?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.530
We could've finished him with one strike,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.790
but you insisted on tracing the clues

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.000
and took

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.700
all his money and valuables.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.300
And what happened?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.340
We were surrounded

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.670
by 32 constables from the Six Gates Bureau

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.610
and nearly died in his mansion.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.940
That's because...

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.700
Shut up.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.730
And that time

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.850
at Xuehe Manor,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.890
when we went after the Sword Ghost, Wang Ba.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.300
You just had to sneak into his library,

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.900
saying you wanted to collect some martial arts manuals,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.990
and we ended up trapped by his mechanisms.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.380
After Su Muyu succeeded

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.220
as head of the Su family,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.490
he opened an apothecary in Nan'an City?

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:52.770
Yes.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.050
We sent people to keep watch,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.700
but they were discovered.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.330
Someone intervened

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.490
and crippled their martial skills.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.900
It seems to be a warning.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.050
We've only posted

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.420
a few watchers

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.380
outside Nan'an City now.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.420
We have no idea

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.250
what they're up to.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.940
What about Su Changhe?

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.380
He returned to Blood River.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.860
Judging by his moves,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.810
he's after the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.180
But the Three Officials have left.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.090
He took in the disciples from the Three Families who remained in Blood River,

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.620
and then left.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.250
Send a message to the Three Officials.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.380
Now is the time

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.530
they meet.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.460
Sir,

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.090
is this to form an alliance with them?

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.140
Even though an unruly sword

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.290
is hard to control,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.330
if we hold it in our hands,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.770
only then can we achieve true domination.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.810
Your Eighteen-Sword Array

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.530
is amazing.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I could sense your sword aura

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.770
from a distance.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.200
But how will you retrieve

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.420
the swords you release?

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.660
Changhe had the Ban family

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.570
specially make this umbrella

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.420
for me.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.730
Back then, when I launched the Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.460
I used ordinary paper umbrellas.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.730
They broke easily,

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.980
and after each launch,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.860
I had to gather the swords myself.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:53.980
Honestly,

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.380
if you ever have to use

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.730
this sword array to attack in the future,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.180
wouldn't you have to

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.420
pull the swords

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.380
out of each body?

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.810
There's no assassin in the world who would do that.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.440
As long as the mission is completed.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.720
They're dead,

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.770
they won't see me gathering the swords.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.900
I'll take more jobs

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.490
and save up

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.940
to buy you a decent umbrella.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.460
Otherwise, partnering with you

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.180
on a killing mission

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.490
would be too embarrassing.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.660
Here.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.800
All right.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.730
Thank you.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.190
You're so kind.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.570
Changhe said

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.290
an assassin shouldn't look like that

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.730
after a kill.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.940
This is just a sword.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.700
Why must one possess it

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.530
to rule Blood River?
