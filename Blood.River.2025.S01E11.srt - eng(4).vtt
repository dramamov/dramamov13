Miracle physician,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.130
you must have been hungry.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.130
I'll cook.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.130
Well...

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.290
No need.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.410
I...

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.740
I'm not hungry.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.570
You worked all day. How could you not be?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.810
Today,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.540
I even asked Miss Wang next door.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.260
Turns out the dish I made yesterday

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.410
was missing one spice.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.690
Fix that will improve the taste.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.320
Su Muyu,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.750
you go out every day,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.700
walk around,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.760
pick up groceries,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.700
help me choose herbs,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.400
and decoct them.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.730
That's already a lot.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.690
You don't need to cook as well.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.060
You work harder every day.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.170
As for the chores,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.290
just leave them to me.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.980
Su Muyu.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.450
How can you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.540
master the sword...

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.500
Because...

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.450
...yet fail

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.380
at cooking noodles?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.060
I'm not eating.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.890
Fine.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.600
It's your effort, after all.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.170
When I go out tomorrow,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.690
I'll buy flower cakes to make it up to you.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.130
And ask Miss Wang again...

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.850
Su Muyu,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.730
can you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.340
promise me one thing?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.410
All right. What is it?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.220
Promise me

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.100
to spare Miss Wang and spare me.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.010
Try a few more times,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.540
I'll get it right.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.380
Same with sword practice.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.940
As for this bowl of noodles,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.500
you'd better not eat it yet.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.940
Wait till tomorrow.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.940
Everyone in the martial world

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.820
trains with a sword,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.730
yet only a few become Sword Deities.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.540
There are so many physicians,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.220
why am I the miracle physician?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.290
Because of talent.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.570
Everyone's born with different gifts.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.170
Su Muyu,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.040
some things

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.570
can't be forced.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.780
When I first learned the sword,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.170
I was clumsy too.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.930
I can't talk you out of it, huh?

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.580
What's that?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.850
They're chickens Mrs. Chen sent over.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.930
She knows I'm learning to cook from Miss Wang,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.340
so she sent them for practice.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.580
Since fate points the way,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.730
allow me to show a little skill.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.050
I learned this from my master,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.570
Herbal Chicken Stew.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.050
How is it?

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.980
Smells amazing!

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.730
It tastes even better.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.980
Go on, try.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.140
Okay.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.490
I didn't expect you to be such a good cook.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.370
These days,

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.780
I've really made a fool of myself.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.290
You flatter me.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.100
I'm only good

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.730
at this one dish.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.540
When I was little,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.540
my master taught it to me.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.140
But later, every time I made it,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.610
I'd think of him.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.100
And every time I did,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.730
I felt so sad,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.980
so I stopped making it.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.330
Never thought

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.680
after all these years,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.590
my cooking

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.860
would still be this good.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.170
Sorry about that, miracle physician.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.660
That was all when I was a kid.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.370
I'm grown now.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.930
I'm not hung up on something so small.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.020
Besides, death

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.610
is just part of life.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.460
Even a miracle physician

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.370
can't prevent it.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.780
While I was cooking just now,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.410
I realized

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.460
I wasn't sad anymore.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.340
Thinking of him again,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.290
my heart

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.730
felt warm.

She should've said so!

The Scholar-Sword Deity!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.020
I came to this city to read

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.570
and sensed

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.570
there's a most unusual guest,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.210
[Xie Xuan, Scholar-Sword Deity]
so I paid a visit here.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.570
You're the one

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.730
who never trained with a sword,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.850
yet the first time you drew,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.100
you looked every inch a Sword Deity,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.760
Xie Xuan?

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.570
An honor at last!

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.450
I'm Bai Hehuai,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.690
miracle physician of Medicine King Valley,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.780
senior to Xin Baicao.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.570
You're Mr. Xin's senior?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.930
Right.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.090
Fair and square!

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.540
I'm of the same generation as Sikong Changfeng.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.330
He's half a disciple

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.970
of Mr. Xin.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.210
So you're two ranks above me.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.060
I should call you grand-master.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:36.930
My apologies.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.810
Greetings, Physician Bai.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.850
So...

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.660
I'm that remarkable?

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.730
Didn't expect to meet you

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.610
in Nan'an City.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.660
Did you visit here

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.970
just to meet me?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.730
I wanted to know why you're in Nan'an City.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.730
It's not to kill.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.730
That's all I needed to know.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.610
Since we've met,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.610
why not stay for a meal?

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.260
Nice to see you smile at last.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.380
Sir,

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.020
enjoy your meal.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.810
Miss,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.300
try these fresh-baked flower cakes.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.850
You look new around here.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.210
Are you here to sightsee?

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.380
No.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.690
I'm looking for someone.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.260
Oh, looking for someone?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:46.900
Enjoy your meal.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.330
They say, "I pick fresh every day;

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.570
good cooking has its secrets."

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.380
Cooking's like swordwork:

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.140
miss one move,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.260
and nothing flows.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.570
What you make

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.850
won't look good,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.900
smell good,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.020
or taste good.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.690
Smells amazing!

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.140
Didn't expect you

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.660
to be a kitchen deity too!

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.690
I'm no kitchen deity.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.850
I just read many recipes,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.300
traveled many lands,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.690
and tasted many dishes,

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.450
so I learned to cook plenty too.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.260
The way of cooking

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.570
runs deep.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.730
I'd like to hear more.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.610
Su Muyu,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.060
Xie Xuan...

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.500
You two changed careers?

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.610
City Lord Li.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.140
City Lord?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.570
City Lord...

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.900
This young lady

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.480
is Xueyue City's Second City Lord,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.330
Li Hanyi,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.660
You're Sword Deity Xueyue?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.330
You must be

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.570
the miracle physician

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.380
who treated Blood River's Patriarch.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.850
Didn't expect you to be so young.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.260
And you're the one

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.140
who created the Floral Sword Art,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.140
calling flowers with a single stroke,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.090
Sword Deity Xueyue?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.500
I am.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.180
And the sword in your hand

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.660
is the one kept in Kunlun

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.730
that can freeze the sunset with a single slash,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.020
the coldest sword under heaven,

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.090
Froststeel?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.970
How good a sword is

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.090
depends on who holds it.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.900
Why does this scene feel familiar?

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.810
The legendary Floral Sword Art

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.090
must be a stunning sight.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.610
Care to let me see it?

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:33.330
Miracle physician,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.420
Sword Deities don't draw lightly.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.970
When they do,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.060
the city's swept in snow.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.690
True.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.850
I don't draw lightly.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.900
But meeting you...

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.210
I might draw at any time.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.730
Aren't you two

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.300
friends?

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.970
We once fought side by side

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.300
against the Demonic Sect's leader, Ye Dingzhi.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.420
But we're hardly friends.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.810
In the jianghu,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.020
no one wants

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.970
to be Blood River's enemy,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.610
nor does anyone

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.500
want to be Blood River's friend.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.780
City Lord Li and I

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.900
are quite close.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.850
I'm senior to Xin Baicao of Medicine King Valley.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.300
Your Third City Lord,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.420
Sikong Changfeng,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.450
was once trained at the Medicine King Valley.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.420
He counts as half a disciple of Baicao.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.780
So,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.230
Sikong Changfeng

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.610
should call me grand-master.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.730
You really put it to use.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.330
Didn't expect someone so young

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.330
to be Medicine King's senior.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.930
The real deal!

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.730
My apologies.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.610
Not at all.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.180
My rank's just too high,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.540
so everyone thinks

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.810
I'm ancient.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.850
Truth is,

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.600
my mother

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.300
is the blood sister of Wen Luoyu,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.090
the Heir Consort of the Marquis of Zhenxi.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:07.970
Your First City Lord,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.260
Baili Dongjun,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.570
is my cousin!

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.300
My senior is your cousin?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.210
We're family.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.660
Stay here

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.610
and eat with us.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.500
Come!

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.090
Smells great.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.260
You hold your liquor, miracle physician.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.210
Naturally, bottomless.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.260
And this wine

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:48.930
is really good,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.500
with a hint of peach blossom,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.610
and a touch of sweetness.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.090
The peach note...

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.570
A friend from Wangchengshan Sect left it

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.970
after a consult.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.140
It was brewed by his junior, the sect leader.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.420
That junior's swordwork

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.260
is now legendary

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.380
across the jianghu nowadays.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.000
True,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.610
I haven't seen his swordplay.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.090
But his wine

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.260
is indeed superb.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.140
How's the wine?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.570
Taste good?

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.300
It's great.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.610
Miss Li,

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.180
you're stunning,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.930
yet cold as frost.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.140
Nothing seems

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.450
to move you.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.060
I thought

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.500
you'd simply say "not bad,"

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.090
didn't expect outright praise.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.720
Looks like this wine

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.760
really is good.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.020
Dishes are all here.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.420
Let's eat.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.380
[Healing Hands]

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.300
I know why you're here, Miss Li.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.130
Rest easy.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.130
Blood River has no agenda in Nan'an.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.220
But the miracle physician's place in Qiantang City

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.890
was exposed,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.980
so she moved to Nan'an,

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.850
As for me,

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.700
I needed treatment,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.940
so I came along.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.650
That day in Jiuxiao City,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.020
I thought

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.850
even if you couldn't disband Blood River,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.370
you'd be

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.170
the new Patriarch.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.260
But in the end,

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.460
Su Changhe became Patriarch,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.740
and you

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.980
came to Nan'an,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.220
far from Blood River.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.300
That's not the ending

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.330
Su Changhe promised me,

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.740
and it's a very, very bad one.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.220
Your bias against Changhe

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.300
still runs deep.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.610
Bias?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.330
Xie Xuan said

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.220
your dear brother

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.940
may not be the worst man alive,

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.700
but he's surely

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.170
the most annoying.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.130
His thick skin

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.890
is rare in this world,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.940
a "classic" for the ages.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.780
A "classic" for the ages? Seriously?

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.370
You're a bit drunk.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.330
Those were Xie Xuan's exact words.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.130
I only repeated them.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.610
Didn't expect Sword Deity Xueyue

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.410
to speak ill behind someone's back.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.940
Worse,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.220
the other one badmouthing me

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.610
seems to be here too.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.130
A brief spar

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.740
is more than enough.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.740
We meet again.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.940
I should call you Patriarch now.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.980
You flatter me.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.850
Just call me Changhe,

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.130
much friendlier.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.650
You deceived me.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.330
I've decided to kill you here.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.570
I never liked Changfeng's choice.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.540
An outfit like Blood River

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.020
has no place in the jianghu.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.130
With Su Muyu as Patriarch, it could stand.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.810
If I took over, you'd tear it out by the roots?

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.700
Looks like my reputation

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.780
really is that bad.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.890
Your codename is your reputation:

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.890
the Undertaker.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.850
Does the word

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:35.810
sound lucky to you?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.510
The old Blood River

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.810
might not have needed to exist,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.260
but we want to build a new Blood River.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.890
A new Blood River?

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.260
One that doesn't live by killing,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.330
no longer in the shadows,

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.740
yet walks beneath the jianghu.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.460
How do you plan to change?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.060
That's our affair.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.890
What,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.330
Xueyue City, the foremost city of the jianghu,

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.410
has grown so overbearing

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.170
it won't allow

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.460
any other sects to exist?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.220
I couldn't be bothered to meddle,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.810
nor do I want to.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.300
I only promised Changfeng.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.610
Alright.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.330
Take it as your promise to me.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.300
If the Blood River to come

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.020
is the same as before...

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.300
Su Changhe,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.130
keep your head safe,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.700
and I'll come take it.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.570
What about Su Muyu's head?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.220
You won't take his?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.260
Why only mine?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.890
I'll take his too.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.980
Since you bookworm are here,

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.780
no need for me to linger.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.220
Some person is an eyesore.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.460
I'll come fight you another time.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.460
Oh, she came to fight me?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.130
Then let's not meet again.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.060
What a fierce woman!

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.940
I've heard Blood River's Umbrella Ghost

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.130
and the Undertaker are close friends.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.780
I never quite understood it.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.330
You and he

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.980
seem to walk different paths.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.330
But seeing you today,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.170
a passage came to mind,

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.850
and I understand a little now.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.460
What passage?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.890
"Hearing snow outside the window,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.650
so near, yet so far."

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.400
You mean the two of us

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.610
are close in distance,

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.780
yet worlds apart?

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.500
No.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.330
The nearness and distance between you

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.810
depend on a single thought.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.700
I hope your nearness this time

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.260
lasts till the end.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.370
The meal's over.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.650
The wine's gone.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.650
She's said what needed saying.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.130
I should go too.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.260
Do you know why?

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.330
Back then, several family heads

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.570
ignored Blood River's rules,

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.500
yet had to seize the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.020
before daring to claim the Patriarch's title.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.330
There must be something odd about the sword.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.980
Something hidden in the hilt.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.460
Yellow Springs Pawnshop...

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.300
The world's most secret bank,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.370
and the most secret assassin guild...

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.540
What binds them?

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.940
All I know is,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.950
the pawnshop keeps good things,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.330
very, very good things,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.130
worth a look.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.020
We'll lead Blood River to the other shore

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.740
and erase its bloody reputation.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.410
Stop living by the kill,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.980
and found a sect in the light.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.500
And the most basic, most important thing...

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.220
do you know what it is?

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.220
What?

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.940
Money, Su Muyu!

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.260
All the years of Blood River's funds

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.020
aren't at our base.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.700
Then where?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.260
Naturally, at Yellow Springs Pawnshop.
