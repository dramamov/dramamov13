(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

=Episode 15=

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.890
Not asleep yet?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.060
What about the money on the card?

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.010
It's gone.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.900
I lost it.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.570
Lost it?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.220
You used that money to gamble?

00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:22.780
I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.660
Not in a good mood.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.820
Stop bothering me.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.220
That's Wenwen's education fund!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220
You even used that?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.170
I've tolerated
all your dirty business outside!

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.850
And you still used our child's money!

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.290
Do you deserve to be a father?

00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:38.444
What are you shouting for?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.220
I'll earn the money back later.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.660
I'll make it up. What's the big deal?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.060
Every penny in that fund

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.540
was earned by me!

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.660
Besides,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.220
the house and the car!

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.570
Didn't I earn every bit by playing dumb?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.220
You're sick.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.220
You're the one who's sick!

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.220
Are you even a father?

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.170
Mind your own business!

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.130
Why are you always so disobedient?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.220
Why do you always yell at me?

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.290
Let go of me! Let go!

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.660
Come on.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.620
Come here.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.620
Hold me.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.850
Hold me.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.820
- I won't.
- Be good.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.100
Hold me!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.570
Married for so long,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.850
you don't even know how to hug?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.060
I'm telling you,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.340
the evidence is in my hands.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.340
Don't push me too far!

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.010
You're threatening me?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.850
I'm not even angry.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.380
You know why?

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.060
Because if I get caught,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.540
you're my accomplice.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.340
Then Wenwen

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.220
won't just lose her dad,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.730
she'll lose her mom too.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.540
How scary is that?

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.220
Zhao Shuhui, listen to me.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.010
Keep

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.730
that video.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.570
Keep it safe for me.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.380
If you want,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.100
you can even watch it.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.220
I don't mind.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.930
Eat more vegetables.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.460
Here.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.660
Have some shrimp.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.660
I will eat more, too.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.980
Same as you.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.690
Sibei.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.980
Do you have plans today?

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.980
What's wrong?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.410
If not,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.844
let's go buy groceries together.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.820
Sure.

(Nurses' Station)

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.980
Hello.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.890
Which ward is Huang Guifen in?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.980
I'll check for you.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.370
She's in bed 219.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.620
How is her condition now?

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.250
It's stable at the moment.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.370
She's in recovery now.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.130
That's good.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.060
Please help me give this to her.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.700
You're not going in?

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.460
I've got something urgent to deal with.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.580
Thank you.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.850
All right.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.730
Family of patient 219.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.850
- I was just looking for you.
- Miss.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.088
A lady just now asked me
to give you this fruit basket.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.700
Thank you, Miss.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.300
Where is she?

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:18.488
She said she had
something urgent and left first.

00:10:52.266 --> 00:10:54.180
Sibei, these are Mom's
clothes to change into.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.200
I'll just leave them here.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.890
Have you eaten?

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.730
Yes, I have.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.300
Mom, look what I brought you.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.300
You used to buy these
for me when I was little.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.650
I want you to try blowing it too.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.890
The doctor said it might help,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.333
and could stimulate the muscles here.

00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:14.140
All right, that's enough.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.460
Don't blow too hard.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.911
Your blood vessels are still blocked.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.650
Okay.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.866
- Slow down.
- Give it to me.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.770
I'll put it away for you.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.160
Right.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.650
Use more strength
in your right foot, Mom.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.340
The doctor said
you need to use that leg.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.180
Don't stop after just a few steps.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.377
I can't use any strength.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.140
Right foot.

00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:46.460
Put more effort into your right foot.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.940
Water.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.980
Don't try to get out of it.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.060
No cheating.

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:59.580
You can have a drink
after you finish walking.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:01.980
You're stopping already?

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.300
Then I'll call the doctor.
I'll tell him you refuse to walk.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.511
That you won't do your exercises.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.940
I'll cut you a piece later.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.460
Slow down.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.530
We'll stop when we reach the front.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.530
See, that's not bad at all.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.060
Right, that's good.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.300
Just a few more steps.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.180
Come on, right foot.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.140
Good.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.460
Right foot.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.850
Yes, right foot.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.140
That's it.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:09.980
Go.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.022
Congratulations, Ms. Huang.
You're discharged.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.650
Goodbye.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.940
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.940
Sibei.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.460
We're leaving soon.

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:27.333
Is there anything you still want to do?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.980
Not really.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.060
But since you asked,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.770
I do want to see someone.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.300
Who?

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.300
Mr. Yang.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.580
Mr. Yang?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.820
He was my Chinese teacher
in my high school.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.900
His name is Yang Qiyu.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.420
He's a really kind person.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.740
I almost couldn't finish my senior year.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.140
He told me
there was a donation program

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.740
and helped me apply for a place.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.422
It was a direct donation of 20,000 yuan.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.220
That's how I got to stay in school.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.620
You really should thank him.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.140
What about the donor, then?

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:05.470
Do you know who it was?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.700
No idea.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.810
If I ever find out,
I'll properly thank him.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.500
But that can wait till later.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.020
I have nothing right now.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
Nothing to offer in return.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.060
All right, when I make more money,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.940
we'll thank him together.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.540
What about you?

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.420
Is there anything
you want to do before leaving?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.860
I'll tidy up the shop
and hand it over to Jun.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.900
Dad called,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.620
and said the drainpipe at home broke.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.140
I'll just replace it completely.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.266
No point fixing it again.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.980
He can't fix it without me anyway.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.460
And then I'll go see...

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.020
Qin Nan.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.900
I mean you.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.660
Your own plans.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.020
Not just things for me.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.260
That is what I want to do.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.980
You can't live only for me.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.100
You should have your own life.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.020
What are you saying?

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.044
You're overthinking it.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.540
We're leaving Nancheng because of me.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.460
You're working for me.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.260
Everything is because of me.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.180
You do everything for me.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.177
It makes me
feel like I'm dragging you down.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.420
Sibei.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.820
We're husband and wife.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.540
Isn't that what couples do?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.900
When hardship comes,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.260
we face it together.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.020
All right.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.900
I'm just

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.180
sleep-deprived and overthinking.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.460
Go on, get to work.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.140
Okay, I'll stop being in your way then.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.660
I'm off.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.620
I'm off.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.820
Tonight,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.780
let's make some noodles.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.260
Noodles with tomato sauce.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.660
- Tomato and egg?
- Okay.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.020
Okay.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.460
I'll make it a bit sweeter for you.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.700
- Sure.
- All right.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.020
Then add some...

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.180
Would one slice of beef be enough?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.020
One slice is enough.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.900
Just one slice?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.820
That's all you want?

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.900
One slice is enough.

00:17:55.444 --> 00:17:56.700
The tickets are fine, right?

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.540
No problem.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.260
Buy me two more tickets
for next Wednesday.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.420
Two more of the same, right?

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.660
Next Wednesday, same time.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.900
Wait for me here.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.820
Okay.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.100
This is the deposit.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.100
Make sure you're on time.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.300
(Yunwen Station)

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.300

Sibei.

00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:03.100
Do you have anything
you want to do today?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.740
Nothing much.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.020
This is fine as it is.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.380
I'm thinking
of taking some time to relax.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.220
Where to?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.420
I'll go with you.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.460
I want to go alone.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060
To Guangzhou.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.180
When...

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180
When are you going?

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.300
Wednesday.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.780
I've already bought the ticket.

00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:00.180
You won't blame me
for deciding on my own, will you?

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:05.940
Are you upset?

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.820
No.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.260
When will you visit Mr. Yang?

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.220
Tomorrow, I guess.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.540
It's the weekend.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.780
He should be at home.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.420
We can visit my parents on Monday.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.780
And Tuesday...

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.740
Do you have anything
planned for Tuesday?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.900
You're just going on a trip,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.780
not leaving forever.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.500
Why pack the schedule so tight?

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.980
You're right. I'm rushing it.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:58.380
(Happiness)

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.460
Mr. Yang.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.180
Over here, Sibei.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.540
Mr. Yang.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.380
Sibei.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.460
This is the Chinese teacher
I told you about.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.740
Mr. Yang.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.220
This is Qin Nan, my husband.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.020
Hello, Mr. Yang.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.180
Mr. Yang is like family to me.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.180
No need to be so formal.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.380
Time flies, doesn't it?

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.140
You've grown and matured.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.980
Come in.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:34.880
Let's go.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.820
This way.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.300
Long time no see, Sibei.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.180
How's your mother doing?

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.300
Is she recovering well?

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.980
Much better. She's out of the hospital.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.700
Now she's just recovering at home.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.580
That's good.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.180
Mr. Yang, let me do that.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.380
Careful, it's hot. Here.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.660
Qin Nan.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.220
Go on.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.460
Mr. Yang, Mrs. Yang.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.580
A toast to you both.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.820
Wishing you health and longevity.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.300
And happiness every day.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.140
Thank you.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.180
I wish you two as well.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.940
Success in your careers,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.980
and a happy family.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.700
May you have a child soon.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.460
Here.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.060
- Drink more.
- Sure.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.340
Here, have some food.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.700
- Eat more.
- Mr. Yang, let me top up your glass.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.380
Sibei.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.220
You poor child,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.340
why has your life
been so full of hardship?

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.740
Mr. Yang, let's not talk about that.

00:27:51.577 --> 00:27:52.740
Let me drink to you again.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.700
Come on. Sit.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.540
Sibei.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.580
Qin Nan is a good man.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.180
Cherish your life together.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.100
Treasure him

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.260
and don't let him down.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.860
What has happened doesn't matter.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.500
What hasn't happened yet
is what's worth thinking about.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.260
You're right, Mr. Yang.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.380
(Nancheng No.2 Middle School)

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.500
I don't remember
some of these classmates.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.220
That's normal.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.100
You kept to yourself back then.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.000
This must be our Year One class photo.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.580
Yes.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.860
Let me see.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.180
I'll find where you are in it.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.020
All right,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.700
but why not let me see too?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.900
I want to spot you.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.380
How would you recognize me?

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.500
Don't underestimate me. I can find you.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.900
Here, this one, right?

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.180
Not bad.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.740
Sharp eyes.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.100
Looking at these photos of you

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.340
makes me want to visit your school.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.020
Go then.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:08.900
Sibei.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.500
Take Qin Nan to see it.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.620
You really want to go?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.860
I do.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.180
That up ahead was my old classroom.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.860
See that spot?

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.380
Third row from the back.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.420
That was my seat.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.700
I used to be a top student.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.220
Our class was one
of the best in the grade.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.780
The class across
from us was the worst one.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.580
Mr. Yang was their homeroom teacher.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.020
And also our Chinese teacher.

00:29:42.933 --> 00:29:44.420
So you looked down on poor students?

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.220
Of course not.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.180
I just worried that
if I worked too hard and did too well,

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.420
they'd resent me.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.940
Impossible.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.100
Your school wasn't like that?

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.180
Of course not.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.020
Our school was full of poor students.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.220
We were all about the same.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.755
No one could look down on anyone.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.930
Come on.

00:30:53.133 --> 00:30:54.380
I'll show you the playground.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.220
Let's go.

00:30:58.844 --> 00:31:01.020
There used to be
a flag-raising platform over there.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.420
Every Monday, the school would pick

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.100
one outstanding student
to give a speech.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.220
I gave one once.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.500
What did you talk about?

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.420
Studying hard?

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.420
I wrote the speech myself.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.020
Mr. Yang even praised it.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.180
I still remember the title.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.860
"The Best Is Always in the Future."

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.820
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.220
No despair that can't be endured.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.300
The strongest thing
is always in our hands.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.420
The best is always in the future.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.420
Three, two, one.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.980
Cheese.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.460
Do you believe that?

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.380
I did back then.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.900
And now?

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.500
Once I get to
the provincial capital on Wednesday,

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.580
I think I'll believe it again.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.020
Sibei.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.900
Wednesday is my birthday.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.180
Can you not go?

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.020
No.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.180
I already bought the train ticket.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.700
It'd be a waste not to go.

00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:36.380
I thought your birthday was on the 21st.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.380
That's my lunar birthday.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.666
Then let me celebrate with you at noon.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.740
I'll buy you a cake.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.660
A big one.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.080
Three sides!

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.060
Sibei.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.180
You're the only family

00:37:43.022 --> 00:37:44.180
I have left in this world.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.780
I know.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.140
I've always known.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.500
Because of you,

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.580
I feel like

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.260
I'm not living in this world alone.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.780
That I have a home.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.660
Ye Sibei.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.540
Thank you.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.900
You're talking so strangely today.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.340
We're here to visit the graves.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.900
In front of our elders,

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.780
we should speak properly.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.420
That spot over there,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.380
it'll be for me someday.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.340
Remember that.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.180
There you go again.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.800
You're thinking too far ahead.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.180
Alright.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.140
That's enough.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.220
You go on down first.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.300
I'll tidy up and come down later.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:29.980
Okay.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:30.940
Go ahead.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.140
Grandfather.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.060
Father.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:47.940
Bei.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.900
This is Ye Sibei.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.420
My wife.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.220
My beloved.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.220
(Happiness)

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.860
(Officer Lin)

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.940
Officer Lin.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.180
I have something to report.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.220
(With you in my life,
every day is joyful.)

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.980
Make a wish.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.940
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.380
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.140
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.770
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.140
What did you wish for?

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.460
Not telling you.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.180
Here.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740
What is it?

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.140
Nothing.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.700
Since my grandfather passed away,

00:40:55.177 --> 00:40:56.700
I haven't celebrated a birthday again.

00:40:58.377 --> 00:41:00.044
Thank you for celebrating it with me.

00:41:03.533 --> 00:41:05.360
Then I'll celebrate it
with you every year.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.180
Let's cut the cake.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.740
Alright.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.880
Why did Mom put things up so high?

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.780
Look how thick the dust is.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.980
Dad, you didn't stop her?

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.620
How could I stop her?

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.260
If she doesn't put them high,
there's nowhere else to store them.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.180
She still complains about you.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.540
Says you sold the house back then.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.180
Now the prices

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.780
keep shooting up.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.740
- Captain Zhang, what brings you here?
- Nianwen.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.300
I came to see your mom.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.980
Just in a personal capacity.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.140
Come in, please.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.180
You're too polite.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.220
Dad, Captain Zhang is here.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.180
He's come to see Mom.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.644
- Hello, Mr. Ye.
- Captain Zhang.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.260
Please, have a seat.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.620
I'll go take a look.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.940
If Mrs. Ye is resting,
don't disturb her.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.460
Let her rest properly.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.580
It's fine. I'll just check.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.460
Alright.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.380
Dad, you go ahead.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.420
- Please sit.
- Sure.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.180
I'll make you a cup of tea,
Captain Zhang.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.700
Nianwen, no need to fuss.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.180
I won't stay long.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.300
It's fine.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.740
Did I come at a bad time?

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.060
Looks like you're packing up.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.220
Are you moving house?

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.180
My sister and Nan
are going to the provincial capital.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.060
So we're helping to sort out

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.500
and pack up my sister's things.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.220
