(Hold My Hand)

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:55.960
Does it hurt?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.439
I don't need it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.879
I do envy Lu Huayan.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.359
She has someone to protect her.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.799
You're mine.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.159
I'll protect you.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.920
You know,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.000
ever since I was a child,
I was always the one left behind.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.400
Abandoned by my parents,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.719
betrayed by friends,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.959
deceived by someone I loved.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.599
You're the only one
who never abandoned me.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.920
Thank you.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.520
Practicing your Wujian force again?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.639
Did you rest well?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.639
I'm fine.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.919
Ever since

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.159
the Night of the Crimson Moon,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.919
your power's been fading bit by bit.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.240
Why didn't you tell me?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.960
I didn't want you to worry.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.039
I can handle it.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360
You should think more about yourself.

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.599
Whatever happens,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
you can always talk to me.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.159
I'm not as fragile as you think.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.240
As long as you're here,

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.719
Then,

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.840
as you wish, darling.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.639
So,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.360
how's your power recovery going?

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.719
Back on the train,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.520
my Wujian force briefly returned.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.039
But it disappeared again soon after.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.520
I think

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.000
it has something to do
with the Mei pearl.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.520
The Mei pearl?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.599
But it's inside me.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.960
And back on the train,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.960
the only person who had close contact

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.000
with you was me.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.520
Don't tell me…

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.800
You've figured something out, darling?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.360
I think I have.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.639
Like this?

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.959
Maybe not.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.360
You were holding me tighter,
weren't you?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.720
Like this?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.240
Try again.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.800
Still not working.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.720
I think I've got it.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720
Back on the train,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.199
we were holding hands tightly.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.519
Give me your hand.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.199
Try it now.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.120
Was it the power company?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.360
Do it again.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.000
I can't believe

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.560
the Mei pearl inside me

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.000
can actually restore your Wujian force.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.959
Let's stay like this,

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.800
hand in hand, forever.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.360
I'll give you all the energy

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.920
I have inside me.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.199
Yan,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.759
I'm glad I have you.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.519
What's wrong?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.240
The lights went out again.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.720
Time for bed.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.720
I made you breakfast.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.600
Try it.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.319
You made breakfast dressed like that?

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.920
So what?

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.759
Life needs a touch of ceremony.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.360
Why are you cooking for me?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720
I'm your personal assistant now.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.000
This is part of the job.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.000
I don't want to eat this.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.720
What do you want to eat?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.920
Steamed lamb? Steamed bear's paw?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.660
Steamed deer tail?
Roast duck? Roasted young chicken?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.120
Roast goose?

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.520
Or maybe braised pork?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.560
Braised duck? Soy sauce chicken?
Smoked meat? Processed tripe?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.360
I'll make it right now.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.759
I don't want any of that.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.720
Then what do you want?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.399
I want…

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.240
meatballs.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.240
Meatballs?

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.879
I can make those.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.360
Red meatballs, white meatballs,
Nanjing-style meatballs,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.420
four-delight meatballs,
three-delicacy meatballs, poached meatballs.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.720
Which kind do you want?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.720
I've lost my appetite.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.519
Because…

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.759
you're finished.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.360
Then what should I make?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.689
Steamed lamb, steamed bear's paw,

00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:10.045
steamed deer tail, roast duck,

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:11.190
roasted young chicken, roast goose…

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.090
Braised pork, braised duck,
soy sauce chicken, smoked meat…

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.320
Red meatballs, white meatballs,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.888
Nanjing-style meatballs,
four-delight meatballs,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.220
three-delicacy meatballs,
poached meatballs…

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.120
