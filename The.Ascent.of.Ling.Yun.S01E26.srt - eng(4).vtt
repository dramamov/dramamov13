=The Ascent of Ling Yun=

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.312
=Episode 26=

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:15.744
(Ling Yun under House Arrest)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.040
Who gave you the order?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480
You're still shielding someone
in front of His Majesty?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.800
Are you tired of living?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.600
That day,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.840
Concubine Yun gave me
a packet of incense

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.000
and a silver ingot.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160
She asked me to replace the incense
Concubine Shu normally uses.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.800
I knew harming the imperial heir
warrants execution of the entire clan.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.600
So I informed Concubine Shu in advance.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.280
Concubine Shu can testify for me.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
I never intended
to harm the imperial heir!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.880
Right.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.480
He isn't lying.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.480
If not for him,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.280
I would've been set up by Concubine Yun.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.744
Your Majesty,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.360
I just heard

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520
someone planned to put musk powder
into Concubine Shu's censer

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.200
to induce her miscarriage.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.160
So I ordered the swap.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
The incense I asked Jian to swap

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.200
was mild calming incense.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.200
It absolutely wouldn't
harm her unborn child.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.288
Someone?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480
Who is this one?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.400
The palace is full of gossipers.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.680
I only heard rumors.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.200
I don't know the person's true identity.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
Do you not know and refuse to say,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.600
or perhaps,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.720
that someone is actually you?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.096
Your Majesty,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080
I wouldn't dare harm the imperial heir!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.760
I think

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.280
Concubine Yun isn't such a cruel person.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.000
A simple test of the incense she sent

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.480
can verify if she's telling the truth.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.640
- Summon Chief Physician Zhang.
- Yes.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.280
Chief Physician Zhang,
how is this incense?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.560
Your Majesty,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840
there's no poison in this incense.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.360
But it contains concentrated musk.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
Pregnant women

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.200
must stay far away from it.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.840
What else can you say?

00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:21.240
Your Majesty,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.680
I didn't harm the imperial heir!

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.200
Someone must have swapped the incense.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.200
We grant you two choices.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.880
First,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.080
name the person you claimed

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.560
who framed Concubine Shu.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.120
Second,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.880
take full responsibility yourself.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.080
I'll punish you for attempted murder

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560
of the imperial heir.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.912
Your Majesty,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.680
I didn't harm the imperial heir!

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.200
I believe

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.760
you will clear my name.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.200
Whatever your decision is,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.960
I will accept it.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Proclaim my decree.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.240
Concubine Yun plotted against consorts,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.624
disrupting the harem.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
She is stripped of title,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.800
demoted to court woman,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.840
and confined in Yongxiu Palace.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.200
My devotion to Your Majesty

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
has always been true.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.760
My conscience remains clear.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.648
I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.728
accept the decree.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760
Your Ladyship,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.560
things change in the imperial harem.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.200
But life must go on.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.600
Don't grieve too deeply.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.440
From now on, stay here

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.384
- and take good care of yourself.
- Where's Fu Xiang and others?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.000
Your former servants
were sent to the Disciplinary Court.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.080
They did nothing wrong.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
How can they be punished?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.080
Bearing punishment for masters

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.440
is only natural for servants.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.760
You should worry
about your own situation now.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.840
Help! There's a rat!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.952
Stop making such noise!

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720
Don't you know all Yongxiu Palace staff
have been dismissed?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.880
Madam Jiang?

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.320
Why are you here?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.600
I was ordered to attend to you.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.888
Attend to me?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.200
No bedding on the bed.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.800
Rats in the room.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.600
And no water in the pot.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.200
I'm thirsty.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.680
Hey! You still think
you are a concubine?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.880
If you want water,
fetch it from the well.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.440
You're just a deposited court woman now.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.000
Stop putting on airs here.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.528
Get out.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.800
(Imperial Study)

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.760
Chief.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.640
Chief.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.512
Chief.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.840
His Majesty is still angry.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.040
(Imperial Study)
Don't mention Concubine Yun's matter.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.080
I know

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.080
what I'm doing.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.760
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.920
His Majesty is reviewing memorials.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.520
Don't disturb him.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.840
I prepared calming tea

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.488
to refresh His Majesty.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.704
Wu Linfu,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.720
don't you understand my words?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.080
What do you imply?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.840
You planned to act without my permission.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.360
I want to eliminate you immediately.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.000
Will you do it yourself,
or shall I do it?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.920
You saved my life.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.800
If you want it,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
you may claim it anytime.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.120
You only know how to deceive me
with such words.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.840
Yet I found no sincerity in you.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.240
I have nothing

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560
but loyalty

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
for Your Highness.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.640
Your Highness,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.680
please plead for Ling Yun.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.880
She only changed the incense

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.400
to stop me.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.480
Do you know

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.400
the more you care for her,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.200
the more I must thwart you?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.040
Go tell His Majesty

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.520
that Concubine Yun is innocent.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.480
Are you threatening me?

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.560
After all my care for you,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.040
you actually threaten me for her?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.400
As an imperial consort,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.600
please keep your dignity.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.880
What a pity, Wu Linfu.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.720
This dagger can't kill me.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.960
Look closer.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.528
These...

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.640
These are former exile marks?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.112
Right.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.280
If you harm me with this dagger,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.920
it will be exposed
to the public as the weapon.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.200
By then,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.800
all shall know

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.280
Ling Yun is a previous dynasty princess.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.960
How did you discover this?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.200
Where did you get this dagger?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.488
Back then,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.400
after the Bi family was wiped out,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.280
I sent someone to find it
in your ancestral house.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.656
Wu Linfu!

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.000
What are you doing?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.880
I offended you.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.344
Let this act

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.480
atone for my wrongs.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.400
I beg you

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.240
to spare Ling Yun's life.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.200
Never

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.640
reveal her true identity.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.560
Wu Linfu,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.600
don't do anything stupid.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.800
If you obey me,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.000
I promise I'll spare her life.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.640
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:39.744
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960
Chief Wu.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.944
Get up.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.040
Concubine Ling is confined
by His Majesty.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.480
Without his decree,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.800
I wouldn't dare let anyone in.

00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:54.200
Make an exception.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.400
I just want a brief talk.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.544
I wouldn't dare.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.320
I really wouldn't dare.
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.320
Your Highness.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.312
Lord Wu,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.160
do you intend
to break the rules knowingly?

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:08.520
Your Highness.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.472
Leave this place.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:11.904
Yes.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.624
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.904
Get up.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.184
Yes.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.760
Who would've thought Chief Wu

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.160
would face rejection?

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:43.520
I'll take my leave.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.080
Don't you want to know

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.880
how your Concubine Yun

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.720
came to this plight?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.560
Are you saying

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.720
Concubine Yun ordered you
to replace Concubine Shu's incense?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.880
I wouldn't dare harm the royal heir,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.480
so I came to seek your help.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.080
Your Ladyship, please save me.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.400
Grant me

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.360
a path to survival.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.280
If you want to live,
follow my instructions.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.720
Except for harming royal heirs,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.720
I will do anything.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.160
Then inform Concubine Shu

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360
about this matter in advance.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:13.888
Yes.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.040
Ling Yun claimed

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120
someone intended to harm Concubine Shu.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.200
She merely wanted to save Concubine Shu,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.200
but refused to name the perpetrator.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.920
You changed the incense Ling Yun sent?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.960
Was there musk originally in the censer,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.480
or did Ling Yun order the musk delivery?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.960
Truth and falsehood

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.320
mixed in confusion.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.960
Even I can't discern it clearly.

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:40.320
Despicable.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.240
You call me despicable?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.720
What about you, Chief Wu?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.080
How can you be so certain
that Ling Yun is innocent?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.400
I believe justice resides
in people's hearts.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.320
Concubine Yun was framed.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.200
Her name will be cleared in due time.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.000
I came by imperial decree
to interrogate her.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.120
His Majesty demands
she reveal the truth.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.640
Tell me,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.680
who is this person
she'd rather die than name?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.160
Should I make her

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.040
experience some persuasion?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.080
Your Ladyship, please have mercy.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.240
Don't torment her.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.720
Spare her life.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400
I did say I wouldn't take her life,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.760
but others' intentions

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.560
are beyond my control.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.480
Madam Jiang we sent

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.120
hasn't made any significant moves yet.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.920
Shall I give her a little push?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.600
Why the rush?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.200
We needn't do it ourselves.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.120
Madam Jiang had served
Consort Wan for years.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.320
She'll find a way to eliminate Ling Yun.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.680
Truly brilliant.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.160
Go tell Madam Jiang

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.120
to serve with greater dedication.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.592
Yes.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.424
