00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.333
Captain Zhang wants to talk to you.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.330
Hello?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930
Were you planning
to kill Fan Jiancheng today?

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.740
Qin Nan's going to do it for you.

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:08.100
You need to tell me exactly

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.010
what you planned.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.890
Where did he go?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.620
Answer me.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.730
Say something!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.940
Ye Sibei, you listen to me.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.450
That 20,000 yuan
you got back in your senior year

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.380
was from Qin Nan.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.220
It was his father's death compensation.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.220
It was meant for his own education.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.170
He gave it to you.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.730
He's already given you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.660
half his life.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.780
Are you going to let him throw away

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.060
the rest of it too?

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.220
Ye Sibei.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.220
Talk to me.

00:02:38.422 --> 00:02:39.500
Outskirts of the city.

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:41.890
An abandoned power plant
at the foot of Mount Suming.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.340
I'm sending you the location.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.940
Call Fan Jiancheng and tell him
not to go to the casino tonight.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.740
(Fan Jiancheng)

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.820
(Sibei)

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:02.620
I need to take this call.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.060
Sibei.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.500
What did you say?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.890
I'm going there now!

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.130
What happened?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.450
It's my brother-in-law.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.890
He's going after Fan Jiancheng.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.890
She asked me to stop him.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.060
I'm coming with you.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.620
Come on!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.130
Hello?

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.410
This is Zhang Yong.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.730
Captain Zhang.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.410
Where's Fan Jiancheng?

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.410
I don't know where he is.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.450
He's not home.

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:11.450
Listen to me.
He's not answering his phone.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.060
If you know where he is,
tell me right now.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.290
Your husband's in danger.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.450
If you can reach him,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.533
tell him to come home.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.780
Okay.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.100
I'll call him now.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.340
I'll call him.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.740
I'll call him.

(Sibei,)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.460
(I want you to do well.)

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.900
(I want you to enjoy everything)

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.220
(that I never could,)

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.100
(and find the happiness I never found.)

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.610
(I was drowning in my own struggles)

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.460
(until something happened to you.)

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.860
(At first,)

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.170
(I thought it was duty,)

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.410
(or maybe the part of me)

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.020
(that couldn't accept
seeing you humiliated.)

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.100
(But little by little,)

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.930
(I started)

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.460
(to feel something deeper.)

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.170
(Maybe it was more than that.)

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.220
Sibei!

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.930
- (I've asked myself countless times)
- Sibei!

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.220
- (why I stayed by your side.)
- Sibei!

00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:02.930
(Is it because you were a reflection)

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.660
(of the hope I still had for the world?)

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.570
(But)

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.980
(when you asked me...)

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.850
Could you really accept
what happened to me?

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.170
Could you really love me?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.660
(That was when I realized,)

00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:21.490
(from the moment I began
to accept your weakness,)

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.170
(to understand you,)

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.370
(to share a life with you,)

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.780
(to hear you yelling
on the back of my motorcycle,)

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.100
(to watch the city lights together,)

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.850
(you were no longer
just my faith or my cause.)

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.780
(You were a real person.)

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.140
(Someone I had poured
all my emotions into,)

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.100
(whether it was love,)

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.220
(or something beyond that.)

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.860
(Sibei,)

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.290
(most people think you're the weak one.)

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.370
(But the truth is,)

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.410
(the weak one was me.)

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.370
(I gave in to fate over and over again,)

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.140
(and accepted every future
it forced on me.)

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.980
(But you,)

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.810
(past)

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.020

(bowed to it.)

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.290
(That's what I admired most,)

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.622
(and what I loved most about you.)

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.460
(So in this world,)

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.410
(your being alive)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.580
(Life's better with you by my side.)
(means far more than mine.)

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.410
(From here on...)

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.260
(Life's better with you
by my side every day.)

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.810
(I hope you live happily,)

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.930
(with the world I could never have.)

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.890
(And lastly,)

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.100
(Sibei,)

I'm looking for Fan Jiancheng.

Please?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.660
Qin Nan...

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.370
I was wrong.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.820
I was wrong, all right?

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.660
I'll turn myself in.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.060
I'll give you money.

Please, stop...

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.130
I was wrong...

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.820
I was wrong, Qin Nan.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.420
I don't believe you.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.700
I only believe myself.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.370
Apologize to Ye Sibei.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.130
Apologize to her!

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.940
Okay, I'll say it!

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.370
It's my fault! All my fault!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.530
She didn't frame you.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.700
She didn't frame me.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.730
You raped her!

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.130
I raped her!

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.820
I raped her.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.730
I drugged her.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.530
I thought she was weak and easy...

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.340
She was timid.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.666
I thought she wouldn't report it.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.690
You two...

00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:55.250
You weren't even on good terms.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.060
And

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.130
you were short on money.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.460
So I figured

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.370
even if she did report it,
nothing would happen.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.730
Is that enough?

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.570
Is that enough now?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.250
I was wrong...

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.130
Qin Nan...

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.970
I was wrong...

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.530
You deserve to die.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.340
I don't deserve to die, Qin Nan!

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.130
Is this necessary?

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.060
All this for something so small?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.340
I just

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.060
couldn't control myself!

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.130
Qin Nan,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.130
calm down.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.570
Please calm down.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.130
Even an animal knows when to stop.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.820
You're worse than an animal!

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.220
Yes, I'm worse than an animal.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.730
I'm nothing.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.370
Qin Nan...

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.220
I'll turn myself in.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.580
I'll give you money.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.460
I'll give you everything.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.130
I have a wife and a kid.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.580
They depend on me.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.130
What a shame.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.570
I don't.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.180
Qin Nan!

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.940
Ye Sibei asked me

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.580
to pass a message to you.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.060
She's

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.940
let it go.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.580
That's what she wanted me to tell you.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.940
She's let it go.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.060
She's not holding onto it anymore.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.460
I don't believe that.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.580
I know her.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.530
She can't let it go.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.370
I went to Mr. Yang's house today.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.460
I know everything about your past.

00:16:32.044 --> 00:16:33.580
And I told Sibei everything you did

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.010
to help her.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.530
Just give me a bit more time, all right?

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.530
The case is about to be reopened.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.488
You'll win this time.

00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:43.700
You don't need
to throw away the rest of your life.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.130
You don't need to, Qin Nan.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.420
Think about it.

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:48.940
Ye Sibei is still waiting for you.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.010
If you go down this road,
what's she going to do?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.540
Captain Zhang,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.370
this is a turning point in her life.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.370
Even without Qin Nan,

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.340
Ye Sibei will meet

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.810
other people.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.010
But without justice,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.050
she'll spend her whole life

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.530
doubting the world.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.460
The law will give you both that justice!

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.530
I don't believe it!

00:17:13.955 --> 00:17:15.220
How many years will he get?

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.050
How many?

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.900
Whatever he's sentenced to,

00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:23.860
how could it ever compare
to what she has to carry for a lifetime?

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.090
You think killing him
will make things right?

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.930
Yes!

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.010
If heaven won't deliver justice,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.420
then I will.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.900
No, no, no!

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.180
Who asked you to?

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.330
Who asked you to!

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.300
Come here.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.700
Qin Nan.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.570
One assault

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.220
won't ruin my life.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.140
One lost case,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.140
one failure,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.770
one insult...

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.010
None of it will ruin me.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.860
The reason I was scared before,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.570
the reason I cared so much,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.660
was because deep down inside,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.860
there was no voice
telling me I was enough.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.660
I thought no one loved me.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.290
I thought no one

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.330
had ever actually cared for me.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.010
So I kept denying myself.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.010
Until this happened.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.330
Whenever something happened,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.570
I couldn't face it.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.090
But today, I finally realized,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.860
that's not true.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.570
It's that I didn't love myself enough.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.090
I didn't know how precious I was,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.010
and that's why I wanted
so badly to kill him.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.730
But when I saw you risking everything,

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.900
I knew it wasn't worth it.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.330
This won't ruin my life.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.770
It's just a detour.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.570
Qin Nan,

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.130
you,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.300
me,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.730
we can still have a good life together.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.220
I still have you.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.180
Qin Nan,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.460
justice shouldn't come
at the cost of sacrifice.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.570
If it requires losing you,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.290
then it's not justice.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.330
You've already given me half your life.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.010
I can't take the rest of it, either.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.140
I need you.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.090
I need you to live your life with me.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.860
Qin Nan,

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.090
we can change our fates.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.730
Can we really

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.860
change our fate?

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.570
Yes, we can.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.730
If we keep trying,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.730
there's no fate that can't be changed.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.860
Fate can change!

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.570
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.570
No despair that can't be conquered...

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.570
There's no suffering
that can't be overcome...

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.810
No despair that can't be conquered...

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.580
(Infusion Room)

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.700
(Emergency Department)

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.490
Ma'am, you can't go beyond this point.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.730
Officer,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.290
I'm Qin Nan's family.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.620
I just want to bring him some food.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.290
It's not allowed.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.130
We have rules.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.250
Look, it's really just food.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.460
Nothing else.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.490
I'm sorry.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.620
You'll have to leave.

00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:32.177
How about this?

00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:34.050
I'll leave the food here,

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.250
and I'll go in

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.570
just to say one thing to him, all right?

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.570
We have rules.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.570
No family visits during detention.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.730
Please, make an exception.

00:22:42.488 --> 00:22:44.050
Then can I at least stand at the door

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.810
and see him for a second?

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.490
Sorry. No.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.050
Please cooperate with us.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.490
Just one look, please, one look.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.460
I just want to see him.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.810
I'm sorry.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.250
If I could, I'd let you in.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:57.810
But I can't.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.460
Ma'am!

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.180
Ma'am.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.490
Please leave now.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.700
If you keep this up,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.180
we'll have to remove you by force.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.860
Qin Nan!

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.490
Take care of yourself!

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.700
I'll take care of everything

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.180
and wait for you to come back!

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.940
Qin Nan!

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.460
I'll be waiting for you to come back!

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.730
Qin Nan!

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.510
(Guantian Police Station)

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.380
Sibei. Why didn't you go in?

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.220
Captain Zhang.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.700
Officer Lin.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.860
I'm here to ask about Qin Nan's case.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.844
It's probably not convenient for me
to go inside.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.180
I just wanted to ask
if you could find out

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.570
what's going to happen next.

00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:36.180
He'll most likely be sentenced.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.500
How bad is it?

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.660
Too soon to say.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.810
The court needs to decide

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.860
based on the evidence

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.555
whether it's intentional murder

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.266
or intentional injury.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.940
So, don't worry yet.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.250
Be patient.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.250
Once the results of Fan Jiancheng's

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.180
medical report are out,

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.460
the court will give a verdict.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.220
Thank you.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.860
Sibei,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.860
this case has
its causes and consequences.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.620
We're already tracing

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.155
the drug dealers' transaction records.

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.860
We'll find the evidence soon.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.730
Your efforts won't be wasted.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.530
You'll get justice this time.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.380
Thank you.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.050
Thank you for not giving up

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.380
on my case.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.970
Thank you.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.810
Sibei, please, don't.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.860
It's what we should do.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.800
Things will get better.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.460
They will.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.860
Then, I'll leave you to it.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.700
I'll head off.

00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:50.820

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.820
(Videos, Images)

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.260
(Videos)

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.980
(Copying to USB drive)

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.860
(Completed)

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.620
(If the verdict was fair, why did
Qin Nan risk his life for an apology?)

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.660
(Stay strong, Sibei. Your persistence
will bring light to this fight.)

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.440
(Hello, Ms. Ye. I'm a content creator.)

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.850
(We've been following your story.)

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.460
(Would you be open to an interview?
Contact: Ms. Chen.)

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.330
Hello.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.090
Is this Ms. Chen, the content creator?

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:27.140
This is Ye Sibei.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.620
I'll do the interview.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.810
Slowly now.

00:28:34.688 --> 00:28:36.700
That's great.
You don't even need help anymore.

00:28:39.044 --> 00:28:40.330
Put your hand on the table.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.460
I'll take that.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.180
Let's put this on, Mom.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.380
Where's Qin Nan?

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.660
Mom,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.180
Nan's car service

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.220
just got a big contract.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.420
He's been

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.688
driving back and forth
between here and the provincial city.

00:29:08.688 --> 00:29:10.620
Sometimes he gets stuck
working too late there,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.900
so he doesn't come home.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.380
What about

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.180
your accountant exams, Sibei?

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.010
I've decided not
to take the exam anymore.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.250
I want to learn a trade instead.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.900
That's good, too.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900
Learn a skill first

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.180
and get a job.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.140
You can always

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.220
take the exams later.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.540
No rush.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.620
Sibei, why don't you

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.380
stay here tonight?

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.620
Spend the night here.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.090
Eat more shrimp. Here.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.220
I'll peel one for you.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.460
What?

00:29:43.711 --> 00:29:45.090
You want to peel it yourself?

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.740
I'll do it, Mom.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.180
Let her.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.180
Good for her fingers.

00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:52.860
- Peel it yourself.
- That's right.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.330
I'll peel it for you.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.822
Her fingers still aren't strong enough.

00:30:03.266 --> 00:30:04.700
- Good.
- Use a bit of strength.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.180
Here.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.020
There you go.

00:30:10.111 --> 00:30:11.755
You can peel shrimp on your own now.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.900
You guys eat as well.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.090
Sure. We'll watch you eat.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.940
Good.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.940
You did it yourself.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.860
Wipe your hands.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:29.900
Here.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.740
All right.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.220
I used to have

00:31:01.488 --> 00:31:03.660
a really hard time
getting along with our parents.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.250
Why?

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.460
Mostly because

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.980
I always tangled up the good and the bad

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.330
in them.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.660
When they hurt me,

00:31:21.711 --> 00:31:23.955
I'd think about
all the good things they'd done,

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.660
and then I couldn't say no to them.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.980
But when they treated me well,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.420
I'd remember the bad,

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.730
and I couldn't love them completely.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.620
I loved and hated them
at the same time.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.220
So every day I kept trying,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.220
hoping that if I could
just accept their flaws,

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.940
they'd love me genuinely,

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.380
and become the kind of parents I wanted.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.460
One day,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.980
I finally understood.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.420
I accepted that they had both good

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.180
and bad in them.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.010
Those are two separate things.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.380
They can exist in the same person,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.730
but I can't confuse them.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.220
When someone does wrong,
I should refuse it.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.330
But the good in them

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.460
shouldn't be erased because of the bad.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.220
By your logic,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.940
are there even bad people in this world?

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.420
Someone becomes bad

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.620
not because they make a mistake,

00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:44.220
but because they refuse to change
after making one.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.300
Sibei,

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.570
do you hate Chuchu?

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.700
If not for her,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.420
maybe Nan

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.330
wouldn't have...

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.460
Chuchu was never really a bad person.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.140
The Chuchu I know

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.060
will turn back.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.890
Chuchu,

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.660
Sibei's interview just went online.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.090
Do you want to see it?

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.340
(Power, Confidence, Independent Thinking)

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.650
(Listening)
(Welcome to "Listening.")

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.170
(She was forced into it!)
(I'm your host, Chen Hui.)

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.780
(Support women standing up.)
(Let's welcome today's guest,)

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.400
(Desperate to stay in the spotlight.)
(Ye Sibei.)

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.090
Hello, Sibei.

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:27.380
Hello.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.180
Hello, everyone.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:30.940
I'm Ye Sibei.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.140
Sibei,

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:33.780
can you tell us

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.130
how you've been doing lately?

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.740
To be honest...

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.340
not very well.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.570
Has your life changed much since then?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.090
In many ways, yes.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.050
My work

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:50.890
and my life

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.980
have changed drastically.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.650
Can you tell us more about that?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.130
After everything happened,

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.380
I went to the police.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.740
But once I did,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.340
my mother tried to stop me.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.690
My brother stopped me.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.570
Later, I gathered my courage
and called the police again.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:14.960
I was threatened,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.190
insulted

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.460
and mocked.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.090
They questioned what I had done.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.170
They ridiculed my husband.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.170
They humiliated my family.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.650
All of this was beyond my imagination.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.300
(Shameless! Get lost!
Let's see your performance!)

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.460
(Have some shame!)

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.530
Sibei, you

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.650
seem

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.380
very calm now.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.490
I know those netizens curse me

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.260
because I lost the case.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.260
I can understand that.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.690
(The goddess finally shows up!)
This outcome fell upon me.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.900
(Heard her husband went to jail, too.)

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.860
It truly left me desperate.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.420
I even had

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.420
the thought of taking revenge myself.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.860
(Luckily, my husband stopped me.)

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.050
(I saw someone online ask,)

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.860
("Why did you drink that night?")

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.340
(It was a work occasion.)

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.420
(We were trying to close a deal.)

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.650
(Everyone drank with the client.)

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.820
(Before drinking,)

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.090
(did you consider your safety?)

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.090
I did consider it.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.690
Then why did you drink?

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.740
Actually,
I understand everyone's doubts.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.900
Perhaps it's easy

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.530
to judge right or wrong.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.260
But we live in a society
of personal relationships.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.090
In social occasions,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.820
as an employee,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.010
no one wants to be seen
as uncooperative.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.260
Especially when the client,
the superior,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.300
and colleagues are watching me.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.460
I felt like I was undergoing
a test of obedience.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.170
If I didn't obey,

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.130
I would defy my superior

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.210
and offend the client.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.900
So,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.170
I chose to obey.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.380
(Have you ever gone out alone at night?)

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.340
(Yes.)

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.860
(Have you ever worn)

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.820
(what you thought
was a beautiful outfit)

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.420
(or a short skirt?)

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.340
(Of course.)

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.622
(Who doesn't love to look nice?)

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.130
(At that time,
did you think about safety?)

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.090
I don't quite understand.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.420
We could teach girls to protect

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.980
themselves beforehand,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.860
but instead, people blame the victim

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.650
only after the harm,

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.940
saying it's because of her own behavior.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.780
You're right.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.010
We should give victims

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.170
more support and encouragement,

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.380
so they can stand up

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.530
without burden

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.610
to identify the perpetrator.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.420
The reason I am

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.740
sitting here for this interview today

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.570
is to tell, through your program,

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.420
those girls like me

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.490
who have experienced injustice,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.530
I am not the first,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.420
and probably not the last.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.090
(I chose to report it.)

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.460
(It is a difficult path.)

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.900
(The reason it is hard)

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.210
(is that I hesitated at first.)

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:12.380
(If at the start)

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.740
(I had chosen to do drug tests,)

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.300
(blood tests, and other checks,)

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.490
(the results now
might be completely different.)

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.340
I hope everyone can be stronger than me,

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.860
braver than me,

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.740
and never give up pursuing justice.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.980
Go Sibei!

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.570
(Your courage is unmatched!)
We support you!

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.170
Ye Sibei, we believe in you!

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.422
Keep fighting. We can win, Sibei!

00:38:33.422 --> 00:38:34.610
We are always with you.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:39.050
- Go Sibei!
- Go Sibei!

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.260
Thank you.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.460
Thank you all.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.249
(Brave, independent, confident,
uncompromising,)

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.500
(never giving up, never silent,
thoughtful, not blind following.)

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.220
(Believe in yourself!
Your potential is limitless!)

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.340

I want to surrender.
