00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.640
(You really are the best
at planning surprises.)

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720
(Oh no, I almost overslept!)

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.640
Hey, Shi Yue.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.160
What's up, Mr. Lu Xingchen?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.310
It's so early.
Can't you let me sleep a bit longer?

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.080
No way. I wasn't ready last time.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.520
This time, I'll make it perfect.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.750
Man, you're in love
and I'm the one suffering.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.160
Get up. Come with me.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.910
Yesterday,
when we played that card game,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.000
I learned so much
about what she likes. Come on.

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:37.600
You're really treating me
like your chauffeur.

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:42.740
We've confirmed six stores today.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.030
Only four left for tomorrow.

00:01:44.044 --> 00:01:45.933
Feels like a huge weight
off my shoulders.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.310
If you're free this afternoon,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.550
we could visit one more place.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.030
Mr. Xin's place is nearby.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.440
Sorry, Mo Li.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.180
I already promised Lu Xingchen
I'd spend the afternoon with him.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.600
I told him this morning
that I was sleeping in.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.520
Why lie about that?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.030
He wouldn't let you work?

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.520
It's not about work.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.360
But if I spend the day with you,
he might get the wrong idea.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.110
Stop the car.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.640
What? It's dangerous here.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.710
Isn't that...

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.830
Don't interrupt.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.180
(Ms. Su-perstar)

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.900
(Lu Xingchen)

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.550
Your hair's messy.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.100
(Lu Xingchen)

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.360
I can do it myself.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.150
It's cold. Keep yourself warm.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.080
Gu Liusu.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.480
Lu Xingchen? Shi Yue?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.360
Just what I didn't want to happen.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.420
(Hongkou 1920)

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.480
Why are you with him?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.990
Weren't you supposed to be sleeping in?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.480
Who would've thought?

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.150
A master of time management now?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.590
No.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.640
Is there something wrong with work?

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.790
You're from Xinghan, and she's from GL.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.640
Is GL paying your salary now?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.240
Or did you switch to GL?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.990
Who are you to stop my girlfriend?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.870
Come with me.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.080
Wait, Lu Xingchen.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.480
Mo Li, let me clear things up first.
I'll call you later.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.870
Later...

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:45.480
What is there to clear up?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.960
Say it to him now.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.222
Are you seeing him later or not?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.800
Lu Xingchen, it's just work between us.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.670
Work? What kind of work is that?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.150
Is it easier to work
with someone who likes you?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.520
What are you talking about?

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.640
You really don't know he likes you?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.520
Have you even thought about how I feel?

00:04:13.288 --> 00:04:13.960
You're right.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.550
I enjoy it when people like me.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.830
I like working with them.

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:20.830
That way, I don't have to do anything.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.000
I don't have to try hard.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.960
It really does make things easier.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200
Mo Li, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.710
Gu Liusu.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.960
We're in a relationship, aren't we?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.150
Do you really know what that means?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.120
Lu Xingchen.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.200
You don't actually think

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.120
you're more important
than my work, do you?

you could just pick me.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.790
I wonder if the two of us

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.270
could ever be something more.

Congratulations, Gu Liusu.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.133
Guess being pretty
really makes life easier.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.080
Doesn't Mr. Zhang like you too?

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.400
In my next life,
I want to be a beauty like you.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.880
Is it that hard to admit
someone's good at what they do?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.320
Just because I'm a woman,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.200
you think my success

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.520
only comes from being young and pretty
and liked by others?

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.640
While yours comes
from talent and hard work.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.760
Take a good look

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.440
at your lousy design.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.790
One day,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.030

shines across the jewelry world!

You could see it in her eyes!

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.470
Come on, Xingchen.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.710
Can you calm down for once?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.960
What's gotten into you?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.440
They were practically about to kiss.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.390
Did they actually kiss?

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.910
I didn't see anything.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.910
Even if you didn't see it...

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.760
Right in front of the guy who likes her,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:12.030
she said that her work

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.790
mattered more than me.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.680
She said that about me!

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.680
Me!

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.760
I'm the one
who's loved her the most all along.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.440
Ms. Gu really is something.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.960
She actually made you cry.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.400
She'll regret it.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.870
She'll come and make it up to me.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.710
You okay?

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.560
Starting tomorrow,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.320
I'll never speak to her again.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:05.750
Never!

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.160
Morning.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.960
Everyone, pause what you're working on.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.160
I have an announcement to make.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.710
I've decided that Starry Sea
will follow Secretary Lu's suggestion

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.560
and switch to eco-friendly materials.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.110
Wait, does that mean I can become
a full-time employee now?

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.830
No more internship for me?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.920
We're all part of one family now.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.280
Let's work well together.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.040
Xiaolu.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.280
Help Secretary Lu
with his resignation paperwork.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.750
The desk was cleared
by the time you ordered.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.080
Wait a minute.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.080
What do you mean by that?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.990
You came here
because of the Starry Sea project.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.440
Now that it's wrapped up,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.755
it's only right that you leave.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.200
Gu Liusu, this is a personal vendetta.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.710
Personal? Between us?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.750
Fine.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.920
I admit I said
something stupid that day.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.110
I'm sorry.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.400
I apologize to you.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:23.590
Lu Xingchen.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.680
Every word I just said

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.800
was something I thought about carefully.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.560
I don't have time to play games

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.960
with a kid like you.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.160
Games?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.960
You think my feelings for you,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.750
that I love you,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.440
because it's a game?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.510
Have you ever loved me?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.400
I had feelings for you.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.510
But it's not love.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.560
Gu Liusu, you don't have love in you.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.040
You just need someone
who comes when you call

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.350
and leaves when you say so.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.750
That's right. I don't need love.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.160
Love is selfish.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.040
It's possessive.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.230
I can't stand the ugly side

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.320
of the so-called love.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.440
So let's just go back
to living our own lives.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.960
Fine. Don't regret it.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.510
Thanks for making a scene at the office.

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:27.200
But it doesn't matter anymore.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.990
Wow, Secretary Lu's got guts.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.350
He's too immature for Ms. Gu, though.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.630
Sometimes the childish ones are
the most genuine.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.133
Stop gossiping. Get back to work.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.040
Ms. Gu, these are
the eco-material samples you mentioned.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.320
I found a few different options
for you to look at.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.440
Actually, I've already decided.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.870
I plan to reuse shell casings
from war zones as raw material.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.920
Shell casings from war zones?

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.080
Starry Sea had a bad run
with public opinion before.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.110
I want to make things right

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.200
through this charity gala.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.470
In that case,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.510
people might accuse you
of using charity for publicity.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.870
We can't stop people from talking.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.830
All we can do is follow
what we believe in.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.750
I agree. Let's do it your way.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.920
Let's get ready for Friday's auction.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.920
(Going back to our own paths)

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.470
(might be the best for us both.)

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.280
(Work? What kind of work is that?)

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.080
(Is it easier to work
with someone who likes you?)

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.280
(Lu Xingchen,
sometimes you speak without thinking.)

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.680
(So what will you do now
to make her forgive you?)

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.420
