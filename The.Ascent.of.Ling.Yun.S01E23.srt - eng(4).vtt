00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.312
=Episode 23=

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.680
(Tong An Dies Protecting His Master)

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:17.888
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.128
(Registry)

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.480
Your Ladyship, continue tomorrow.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.240
The candlelight is dim.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.160
It'll strain your eyes.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.800
Your brother is in the palace.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.960
You'll find him at last.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.792
No.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.160
I must find him soon.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.440
Only then can I relieve my anxiety.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.440
Help me look.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240
Calculating by age,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.200
my brother

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.760
should be about twenty now.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:44.480
Medical Bureau's Lin Mo
is also from Qiongzhou County.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.920
Could it be him?

00:00:46.068 --> 00:00:47.480
(Entered palace: Shunzhi 1st Year)
He's 37.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.184
The age doesn't match.

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:50.080
Wait.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.240
Your Ladyship,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.880
Fu Ning from the Imperial Kitchen

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.240
matches in hometown,
entry date, and age.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.360
But the birthday doesn't.

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:01.280
My brother was born at Hai hour,
on the tenth day of the eighth month.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.800
And his parents are still alive.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.128
Your Ladyship,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.320
this method of elimination

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.160
is truly laborious.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.240
Does Your Ladyship recall

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.320
any distinguishing features
of your brother?

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.520
It's been so many years.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.040
How would I know what he looks like now?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.632
Wait.

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:18.520
I remember

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.240
my brother has a scar on his lower back

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.960
from when he climbed a tree
to retrieve my kite as a child

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.720
and accidentally fell.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.560
A lower back scar

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.040
would be hard to verify.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.800
We can't go around lifting men's tops

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.720
to inspect their backs.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.376
True.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.760
I wonder

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.880
when I'll find him.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.960
I just hope he's safe

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.840
within the palace.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.000
Have you heard?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.040
The new Noble Lady Mu

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.640
was originally a horse tamer.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.200
How unexpected.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.840
A horse tamer?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.200
How is that possible?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.440
Why would His Majesty like her?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.000
His Majesty is inscrutable.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760
Who can fathom His Majesty's thoughts?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.960
A stable servant of yesterday

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.520
is now our equal in status today.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.880
The crow has become a swan.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.600
Also, since entering the palace,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680
she's been asserting dominance
over everyone.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.280
So imperious

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.264
and arrogant.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.760
What's she playing at?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.040
Isn't she afraid

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.960
of making enemies?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.360
Why fear?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.640
With His Majesty's favor,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.400
she fears nothing.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.080
Even we senior consorts
must be cautious.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.720
Lest we accidentally offend her

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.200
and invite trouble.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.712
(Registry)

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.440
Your Ladyship,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440
His Majesty brought
a horse tamer from the retreat

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.776
and made her a Noble Lady.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.880
Recently, she's received
exceptional favor.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.392
Hmm.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.024
Your Ladyship,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.040
since Zhao Yanwan
was cast to the Cold Palace,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.840
His Majesty hasn't visited our palace.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.080
If this continues,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.280
our situation will deteriorate.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.960
His Majesty gave me
a superficial promotion

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.720
but an actual demotion.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.440
Due to the commotion

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.640
over Consort Wan's matter,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.832
he's displeased with me.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.040
What should we do?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.480
You'll let Noble Lady Mu
win over His Majesty?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.520
I've heard something
about Noble Lady Mu.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.840
Whom His Majesty favors

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.280
is none of our concern.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.600
Your Ladyship!

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.840
My priority is finding Bi Da.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.440
Nothing else matters.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.120
This searching method isn't effective.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.520
Tong An serves in the Imperial Study

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
and is more resourceful.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.280
Perhaps

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.440
we could ask him for help.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.952
Tong An?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.488
Tong An,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.520
have more bathwater brought for me.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.872
Yes, Master.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.640
Wait for me in the back.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.288
Yes.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.200
(He has a scar on his lower back too.)

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.240
Have you ever wondered why I helped you?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.200
Because we share a common enemy.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.720
Isn't Zhao Yanwan also your enemy?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.240
As Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.440
I make no enemies.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.680
If your brother has become someone
beyond your recognition,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.560
would you still accept him?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.888
Your Highness,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.280
what brings you here

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.400
so late at night?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.240
Nothing.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.120
I got lost.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.120
May endless fortune bless you.

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:18.400
Consort Jing

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.640
invites you to Jinghe Palace for a talk.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.840
Greetings,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.120
Your Highness Consort Jing.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.880
Why has Your Highness

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.080
summoned me?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.488
Sit.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.280
Noble Lady Mu
has newly entered the palace.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.512
Are you aware?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.840
I've heard rumors.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.960
In this palace,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.240
a garden of diverse blossoms
is preferable.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160
A single dominant flower spells trouble.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.320
Your Highness,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.640
with Consort Wan gone,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.040
I no longer wish to compete for favor.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
What if I insist you compete?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.264
What does

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.600
Your Highness mean?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.432
I heard

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.720
you've been looking for your brother.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.440
How does Your Highness know this?

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.800
Palace affairs

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.840
are known to me

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.240
when I wish to know them.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.296
Does Your Highness

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.160
know my brother's identity?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.784
Have you never

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.120
harbored suspicions?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.720
Your brother is

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:50.048
Wu

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.456
Lin...

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.640
fu.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.296
Impossible.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.840
How could it be?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.032
Back then,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.840
Consort Wan framed your father
with false charges and had him killed.

00:07:08.608 --> 00:07:09.520
Your entire family

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.440
was slaughtered.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.920
You and your brother barely escaped,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.200
but during your flight,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.160
you became separated.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.728
Is that accurate?

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.192
Look.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.800
Is this the sachet
your mother embroidered?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.000
It resembles the sachets
Mother made for me and my brother.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.640
So my brother

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840
is truly him?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.440
Had I not rescued him in time

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.640
and raised him within palace walls,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.560
he'd have starved on the streets.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.520
Your Highness,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.200
why reveal this truth now?

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.520
What's your aim?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.600
Meet him first.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.720
We'll discuss further afterward.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.960
(My brother)

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.640
(is truly Wu Linfu?)

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.568
Attendant Cheng.

00:08:30.432 --> 00:08:31.440
Eunuch Tong An,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.640
what brings you here?

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.400
Did His Majesty send you?

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:35.440
Well,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.448
it's not His Majesty.

00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:39.440
Her Highness Consort Jing sent me
to present you the Ten-Tonix Brew.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.760
It's Her Highness?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.520
It's kind of Her Highness
to remember me.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.560
Please convey my gratitude.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.040
Her Highness says

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.920
this brew is made
with millennium ginseng

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.360
and needs to be drunk hot.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.640
Physicians oppose strong tonics

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840
for my weak constitution.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.040
Leave it here.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.680
I'll sip it gradually.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.720
But this reflects
Her Highness's goodwill.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.000
Don't reject it.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.160
Drink it now.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.512
Tong An,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.600
what's truly in this brew?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.480
Why force immediate consumption?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.536
Attendant Cheng,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.520
in this palace,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.240
it's kill or be killed.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.840
I'm just a servant.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.600
We all serve our masters.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.648
I

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.888
have to fail you.

00:09:57.632 --> 00:09:58.680
What...

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.240
What did you make me drink?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.632
Tong An,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.320
has anyone protected you?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.840
I've been bullied since childhood.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.120
Until I met you, Master.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.240
Protected by you,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440
I finally knew
what being respected felt like.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.320
Protecting the vulnerable

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.400
is humanity's benevolence.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.400
When you gain the power
to protect others,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200
you'll understand.

00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:45.536
(Qinglu Hall)

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.440
Someone!

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.000
Fetch more wine!

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.880
Someone!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.880
Fetch more wine!

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.856
Someone!

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.136
Fetch more wine!

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:36.192
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:37.056
Well,

00:11:37.056 --> 00:11:37.920
look at him.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120
Drunk again in broad daylight.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.120
Chief Wu always treated us well.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.720
Should we check on him?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.480
What's going on here?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.592
Eunuch Zhang.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.512
Back to work.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.520
If tasks aren't properly completed,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.240
you'll lose your hides.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.120
Every day,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.400
you pretend to be dutiful.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.360
The moment supervision slips,
you slack off.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.320
As the old saying goes,

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.480
"Faces reveal men,
but not their hearts."

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.120
Today you dare deceive me openly.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.680
Tomorrow,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.792
maybe

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.840
you'll stab me in the back,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.120
making me
some clueless sacrificial lamb!

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.040
What did you say?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.480
Repeat that.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.928
Well,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.200
I said nothing at all.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.280
Unless you've done
something shameful recently

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.040
and were visited by a ghost at night?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.880
So you're being so paranoid?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.384
Well,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.640
lately,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.320
I keep dreaming of Tong An visiting me.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.520
In these dreams,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.040
he weeps endlessly

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.320
and tells me

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.600
how unjustly he died.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.520
Concubine Yun has arrived!
