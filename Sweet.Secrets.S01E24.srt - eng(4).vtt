(Destiny)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.840
What are you doing here?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.879
Go, quickly.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm not leaving.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.760
Foolish human.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.439
You can't bear this.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.840
Go!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.439
Return the Chi pearl to your body now,

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.879
or you'll die.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.879
I no longer have the power
to draw the Mei pearl back into me.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.239
I've always hated letting others
see me in a pathetic state.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.920
Get out!

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.000
I told you,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.079
I'll stay by your side.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.239
(Jing Haisi,)

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.799
(don't forget me.)

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.599
(I'll use the little power I have left,)

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.640
(to return the Chi pearl to your body.)

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.000
(Jing Haisi,)

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.359
(that night, the price
I paid for our exchange)

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:08.840
(was to lose my love forever.)

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.479
(I regret it.)

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.280
What's her name?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.039
She's a dancer from Shanghai.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.080
Her name is Gu Meng.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.840
Gu Meng!

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.039
Your perfume

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.479
smells awful.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.319
What are you doing here?

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.879
You're not the only one

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.919
who cares about Wujian.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.240
Li Motong.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.120
Thank you.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.840
If you have time to talk nonsense,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.240
use it to repair the cracks
in Wujian instead.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.599
What I owed you,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
I've returned it.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:55.560
Are you alright?

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.560
Jing Haisi.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.319
All these years I've been against you,

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.560
because I knew
she was your fated calamity of love.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.199
I only wanted you to live.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.800
But I still couldn't change your fate.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.160
The Mei pearl
has now merged with her body.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.240
If Wujian is to be saved,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.519
it'll depend on her choice.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.160
This is our destiny.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.439
Li Motong,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.560
let me do it.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.399
No, you can't.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.759

I can do something for him.

Mr. Li can actually draw eyebrows.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.120
Have you done this
for other girls before?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.319
Is that why you're so good at it?

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.399
You're the first one I've drawn for.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.759
I'd gladly draw your brows for life.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.920
You're a flower too.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.920
Li Motong,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.600
will we

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.759
have a future?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.519
But you're

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.560
a handsome flower.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.319
The magnolia's meaning is

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.199
pure and sincere love.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560
When the magnolia blooms,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.160
my eyes are full of you.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.240
I want to hold you like this

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:55.920
through every meal and every season.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.639

Nothing in this world

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.959

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.120

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.639
is that you?

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.319
Who said only you could protect me?

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.560
The Bride of Wujian
must also protect her king.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.519
Let go!

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.600

Miss,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.159
do we know each other?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.679
Are you dressed up

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:03.320
as Li Motong?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.440
So?

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.200
For the Li Motong in your novel,

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.799
am I the best choice?

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.600
When I wrote Li Motong,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.720
I thought of you.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.759
I've always felt that between us,

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.000
there was love across lifetimes.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.000
But in my story,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.759
Li Motong always says,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.919
if we cannot love each other,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.960
then let's go to hell together.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.399
Isn't that

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.120
a bit too tragic?

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.759
Hearing you say that,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.120
perhaps it is.

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:39.000
Then let's change it.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.639
Since we love each other so deeply,

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:43.960
let's stay together forever.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.759
I'll be your Li Motong,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.519
and you'll be my Lu Huayan.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:30.639
