(Crimson Truth)

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.640
You Zimei.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.920
When did you tell her I'd die
because of the Mei pearl?

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.040
And when did you tell her
to offer me the pearl?

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.439
Don't think that because
you're the Supreme Priest of Wujian,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.920
I wouldn't dare touch you.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.200
If you dare to manipulate my wife again,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.959
I'll kill you.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:18.760
That's right.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:20.560
I lied to her.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.319
I was selfish.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.120
But I only wanted you to live.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.560
No one can stop my decision.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.519
This is yours.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.519
Take it back.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.080
(After all these years of struggle,)

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.639
(we were both
just pawns in Father's game.)

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.520
(The Chi and the Mei can never reunite,)

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.479
(and Wujian is about to perish.)

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.280
(Brother,)

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.800
(in the Prison of Beasts,)

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080
(you took the blow meant for me,)

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.919
(I won't forget it.)

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.840
(Forgive me.)

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240
From now on,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.319
you don't have to live here anymore.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.800
Mr. Jing.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.879
Are you driving me away?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.000
What's the point of you staying here?

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.000
It's alright.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.599
Let me stay by your side.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.840
Wherever you go, I'll go.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.240
Whatever you need, I'll become that.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.039
As long as you let me stay.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.479
As long as I'm with you.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.560
You said

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.639
you wouldn't abandon me.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.039
You didn't lie,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.199
did you?

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.400
I'm just that fickle,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.080
and who are you pretending to be so pitiful for?

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.840
Pack your things and get out.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.680
Right.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.039
What is love worth anyway?

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.800
Our fate has already been decided,

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.919
but in this life,

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.960
you shouldn't have to
bear the pain again.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.040
Lanyue and I
once defied the Wujian Rules,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.360
and fell in love.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.519
Father and Mother's union
already brought shame upon Wujian.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.600
Father planted the Mei pearl
within you and your sister,

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.600
so that we could never
love each other through lifetimes.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.319
But in our past life, you died for me.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.399
I swore an oath,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.800
never to betray you,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.199
to protect you forever.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:37.319
Wujian

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.319
then sealed my memories.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.920
Please, open your eyes and look at me.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.800
I beg you.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.279
Please.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.079
Please, just open your eyes
and look at me once.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.959
In the dream realm, the Mei pearl's
light reawakened my memories.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.279
I knew then,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.040
our fate continues in this life.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.759
Lanyue,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.639
I've finally found you.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.639
So,

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.160
we're destined to love each other,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.480
yet destined to part again.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.279
Aren't we?

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.480
That's the very rule I intend to change.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.439
A thousand years ago,
you took a blade for me.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.040
I won't let you suffer the same fate.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.040
Lu Huayan,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.839
if you die,

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.519
I'll never live alone again.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.360
Li Motong,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.759
whether I'm Lanyue

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.240
or Lu Huayan,

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.639
whatever the rules or fate,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.279
I've made my choice.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.040
Even if the heavens fall,

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.879
I'll still go forward,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.040
to be with you.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.879
(What must come,)

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.360
(will come eventually.)

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:58.160
(The mortal realm
will soon fall into chaos.)

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.680
The Gate of Wujian is about to collapse.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.360
Wujian's fate hangs by a thread.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.360
I must return to Wujian

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.079
to save it.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.879
I'll go with you.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.959
The Mei pearl is within me.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.639
Wujian's fate is tied to mine as well.

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:22.879
Take me back.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.160
Let's face it together.
