00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.380
Are you a rat or a fox?

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.840
Sneaking in, you have quite the good fate.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.780
That's nothing
compared to your fate of seeking death.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.220
You darn fox.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.780
I didn't notice this
'cause I was always the one below,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.980
but looking closely,
you have pretty delicate features.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.329
Shall I play with you for old times' sake?

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.790
Thinking about having you below me
is making me quite excited.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.360
You still have the habit
of riding on people's heads.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.550
But what to do?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.530
You're the prettiest
when you cry on the ground.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.750
Shall we relive
the beautiful times we had?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.040
You scum!

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.450
What?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.350
Didn't you say we should relive
the beautiful times we had?

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.650
You're so wooden.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.010
No wonder you were abandoned.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.710
That crazy fox, seriously—

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.010
Come in.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.780
Gildal!

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.760
I saw Dr. Jigwi in our home just now.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.630
Oh...

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.550
I think I brought him here.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.870
I got drunk and...

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.630
But they got really close and...

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.500
And...

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.580
A-A-And?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.150
The atmosphere was so dark.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.060
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.000
What's their relationship?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You said they had bad blood.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.060
Might've slept together...

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.079
What?

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.340
No.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.070
Did sleep together...

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.220
What?

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.110
So he's in that kind of relationship
with Dr. Jigwi?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.030
You can't tell him.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.900
Bihyung doesn't even know
that you have met Jigwi before.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.580
But if he finds out,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.210
you'll be kicked out immediately.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.900
You saw nothing.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.909
You didn't come to my room,

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.950
nor have we talked about this.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.750
Nothing happened, just as usual.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.450
Got it?

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.980
Yes.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.470
Might've slept together.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.120
No.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.170
Did sleep together.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.340
You're the prettiest
when you cry on the ground.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.500
Shall we relive
the beautiful times we had?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.290
Nothing happened, just as usual.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.650
Got it?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.280
Why are you acting shy?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.460
You have good taste.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.280
A-Are you having breakfast?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.310
Why?

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.060
Can't I?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.940
This is the first time we're having
breakfast together. I'm surprised.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.130
Is the sun rising in the west today?

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.260
You don't want to eat breakfast with me?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.980
No.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.130
That's not it.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.020
We drank together all night

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.000
and are sobering up together
in the morning.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.030
This is a complete date...

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.520
Put more vegetables.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.370
Thanks to someone, I used
quite a bit of strength last night.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.300
Yeah, that must have been the case.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.980
Why isn't he here yet?

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.280
He always comes on the dot
at mealtimes.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.080
I'm a little late.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.660
You...

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.850
Why do you look like this?

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.690
What's wrong with him?

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.530
Is it because of Jigwi?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.730
I shouldn't have let you two meet
to start with.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.140
It's all my fault.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.380
Whatever.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.450
I can't just abandon a drunkard.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.360
What?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.140
Gosh, but his temper is still
as terrible as ever.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.910
He hasn't changed at all.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.030
Don't let Keumpoop run into him.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.860
What?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.120
What about me?

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.940
People like you are his type.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.820
You look like you'll fall for beauty
and give up everything, even your liver.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.430
I'm not like that.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.670
You're right.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.790
Living with someone like me, normal people
won't be up to your standards.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.970
Right?

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.159
Just eat.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:57.070
Shall I?

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.840
You haven't sobered up yet?

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.290
What? Why?

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.060
Why is this so sweet?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.770
You're amazing.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.470
You can even make honey water
out of dried pollack.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.270
I'll make it again. Stop eating.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.930
Thanks for the meal.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.510
I'll be taking my leave.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.250
He...

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.549
Why is he acting like that?

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.870
He ate it all.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.390
Bihyung slept with Jigwi...

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.770
So, the engagement
that Gildal mentioned before...

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.050
Was it with Dr. Jigwi?

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.060
An engagement?

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.660
Is someone getting married?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.430
That's not it.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.270
Ma'am,

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.530
can couples who broke up on bad terms

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.850
still kiss and sleep together?

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.650
That's physical attachment.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.160
What? Physical attachment?

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.930
But I heard it was a really bad breakup.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.370
That makes it even more likely to be physical attachment.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.020
They are attracted
to each other physically,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.190
make mistakes again,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.650
and ruin everything again.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.830
Ruin everything?

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.170
What should I do then?

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.130
What can you do?

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.800
Just stand by and watch.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.530
It's someone else's business.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.090
Someone else's...

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.870
But I can't.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.930
Goodness.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.750
You said you'll be auditioning soon.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.420
How can you be distracted?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.840
I'm starting to get physical with him.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.210
What should I do?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.680
Dating

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.670
is similar to eating.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.190
In other words, right now,
you're giving food out to him

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.410
even before knowing what he likes.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.880
Situations like this
normally end badly.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.590
But we love eating, right?

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.720
There is one way

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.400
to avoid it ending badly.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.360
That is...

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.090
What are you doing?

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.290
Aren't you studying?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.230
This is also studying, okay?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.920
Studying about life.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.410
Is there a need to study things
this blatant?

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.200
It's easy.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.600
What is it?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.250
Our Samsin Halmeoni is already so old,

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.510
yet she still has the mental age of a baby.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.460
Hey! Whatever.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.120
You don't know either, right?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.470
What is it?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.030
You have to bait them—it's like
you're giving it to them but not.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.080
Make it so they can't choose.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.680
There is one way

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.450
to avoid it ending badly.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.780
That is...

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.070
this burning sincerity.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.750
Confess passionately and stamp it on them,
"You're mine."

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.670
Stamp it...

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.480
You're already at this stage.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.200
Is there any other way?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.050
Is this taking the confession
as a chance to scold them?

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.960
Hey, if you made me fall for you,
you should take responsibility.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.780
Are you a piece of trash that'd just
run away

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.150
after pulling your pants up?

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.740
No! I'll take responsibility!

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.110
[Gildal]

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.960
Hello.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.320
Hello?

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.020
It's me.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.080
Gildal.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.970
What is it?

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.360
I was worried
because you weren't picking up.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.850
Worried about what?

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.960
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.070
I want to talk about last night.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.350
Must we?

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.020
Is there a need?

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.810
Of course.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.980
That s-something like this
happened despite our relationship.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.670
Something like this?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.640
What's our relationship?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.750
What?

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.410
I don't really know
what our relationship is.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.070
Call me when you figure it out.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.120
[To Gumiho Plastic Surgery CEO, Jigwi]

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.690
[Do you like this type these days?]

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.930
With the tiger not at home,
the fox claims to be the king.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.080
Sneaking in, you have quite the good fate.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.480
That's nothing
compared to your fate of seeking death.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.910
How dare you. With Keumpoop around, I...

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.800
Who are you calling a kid?

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.460
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.820
I'm afraid there will be trouble
when I see you.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.160
It's someone else's business.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.580
Keumbok.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.920
Put away your apron.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.860
Remember to lock the door.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.130
I'm heading off.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.140
Okay! Goodbye!

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.650
What?

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.670
It's raining.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.070
Jeez, I didn't bring an umbrella.
I'm done for.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.980
Huh? Why is this here?

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.030
It's all cooked.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.820
Almost.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.550
See you.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.170
Ha Keumbok!

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.100
Are you okay?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.270
Are you calmer now?

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.579
Which crazy ghost dares to do this?

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.880
You promised me that
I wouldn't see them, right?

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.480
I'm sorry.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.670
I was careless.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.880
It's all my fault.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.150
It's not your fault.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.700
It's my fault. Why are you taking my side?

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.780
I mean...

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.720
you came to save me.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.370
What are you doing?

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.420
It's a mess now.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.540
I'm relaxed now.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.150
I'm not referring to you, but your energy.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.660
What about that?

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.290
It'll be dangerous if this continues.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.820
You might fall for something again.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.920
What should I do then?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.070
Let's hold hands and spend a day together.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.920
What?

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.890
Or find your pulse.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:01.860
M-My

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.110
pulse?

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.260
It's the path that the essence takes.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.540
Because your breath is a mess,
your pulse has hidden itself.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.600
Ha Keumpoop, take off your clothes first.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.600
Cry or laugh—just choose one.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.450
It tickles!

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.010
You haven't found it yet?

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.590
It's been 10 minutes.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.590
Give me your hand.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.260
Why do you keep sniffing it?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.420
Are you a dog or what?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.530
There's a pulse in the place
where the scent gets stronger.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.660
Why do you keep saying I smell?

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.650
Freshly cooked fried chicken.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.930
Guess you can't help it.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.060
But am I sweet and spicy sauce
or original fried chicken?

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.710
Focus!

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.640
Are you nervous?

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.390
What?

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.840
N-No.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.050
Why would I be?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.590
Because I'm too handsome.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.860
What are you talking about?

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.750
I used to be in a beauty pageant.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.420
I know you're pretty.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.870
Sit down,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.180
Cabbage Kid Champ.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.310
But...

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.790
Don't move.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.690
No, I'm not moving.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.960
I have something to say.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.710
What is it?

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.960
Do you...

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.530
like...
