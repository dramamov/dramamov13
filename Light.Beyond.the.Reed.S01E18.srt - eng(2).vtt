Looking for something?

Are you looking

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.380
for the videos
of the girls you violated?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.540
You watched them?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.130
Yes.

or copy

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.820
the videos?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.450
I deleted them.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.540
I copied them, too.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.220
Where are the videos?

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.890
Where are they?

Where did you put them?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.500
I gave them to the police.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.380
Even if you choke me to death,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.500
you can't escape!

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.730
You really are...

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.570
You really are...

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.450
killing me.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.580
That's great.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.580
I know.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.250
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.100
Alright.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.980
Master.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.020
Master.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.490
Cut to the chase. I have good news.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.660
I have to rush over.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.220
Yours won't beat mine.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.290
What is it?

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:46.800
Chuchu just called me.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.280
She admitted that she had given
perjured testimony during the first trial.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.980
She'll be here soon.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.420
Really?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.290
And you? What's your news?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.170
Zhao Shuhui gave evidence
of Fan Jiancheng's crimes.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.140
That's great, Master.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.410
We can finally bring

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.340
this scumbag to justice.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.490
Can't you be gentle?

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.100

Sibei.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.540
I'll drop you off here.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.020
I have to drive later.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.650
Nianwen.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.610
Don't give up your career

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.290
because of me.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.220
Hello, Officer Lin?

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.340
Hello, Sibei?

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.780
I got good news.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.780
There's new progress in your case.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.540
I can't disclose

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.020
the details,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.930
but your case

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.730
can be retried.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.650
Thank you.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.650
You're welcome.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.250
Sibei.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.810
What is it?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.490
Officer Lin said

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.930
my case can be retried.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.860
Really?

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.250
That's great.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.730
That's great.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.610
Then,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.610
did the police find new evidence?

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.220
Maybe it was Chuchu.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.290
Go on.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.490

(Police)

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.930
That's what happened.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.660
That's why I committed perjury and lied

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.460
in the first trial.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.220
You can go home now.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.610

Chuchu.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.980
Let me take you home.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.220
No need.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.140
I can go home by myself.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.460
It's going to rain soon.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.780
Take an umbrella.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.730
Why are the police here again?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.370
Just take it.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.940
You're Tao Jie, right?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.380
(Police)

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.370

Come with us.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.730
Hello, are you Ms. Ye Sibei?

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.460
Yes.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.250
I'm the owner of Yazhi Boutique.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.180
Mr. Qin

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.770
ordered a custom dress from us.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.060
I'm delivering it now.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.610
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.580
Please forgive me.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.420
Thank you.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.100
(Jinxiu Residential Area, Fuyang Street)

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.420
How about wearing a dress?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.220
No.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.180
Then promise me.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.060
If we win today,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.010
I'll buy you a dress.

00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.530
(Linjiang City Intermediate People's Court)
April 2018.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.250
The sexual assault case in Nancheng

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.850
finally entered a new trial.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.100
Is it workplace assault

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.700
or a scandal of sex for favors?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.060
Today, the court will give us an answer.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.250
Since the case began,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.220
(Feiyue News)
the story has kept having twists.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.890
More and more netizens
joined the debate.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.650
They cursed the victim,
then the accused.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.300
It makes us wonder

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.180
whether public involvement

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.580
in private cases

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.890
causes deeper secondary harm
to those involved.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.460
Sibei, you can do it.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.940
Don't be afraid, Sibei.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.890

You can do it.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.530
Go, Sibei.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.010
Go.

(I know who they are.)

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.220

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.340
I heard you're a lawyer again.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820
Congratulations.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.850
Thank you.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.130
I'll keep working hard

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.340
to become a good lawyer.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.060
Ms. Ye.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.130
Everyone has the right to defense,

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.850
but truth won't be buried

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.100
because of my defense.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.460
I hope you understand.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.220
I'm scared.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.460
Because I left Ye Sibei in the car.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.730
Suddenly, all the criticism online
turned toward me.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.980
They tried to dig up

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.850
every flaw in my past,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.980
constantly proving

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.010
that I'm a terrible person.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.460
(Witness)
They said I left her on purpose.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.340
(Prosecutor)
My clothes,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.370
my behavior,

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.370
even my past relationships...

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.580
Everything about me

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.340
that didn't fit their "good girl" ideal

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.130
became their target.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.220
During that period,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.130
I fell into anxiety and depression.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.490
I scrolled through the internet daily,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.010
every day, again and again.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.490
I desperately wanted to prove

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.580
that I was a good person.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.490
I hoped they would stop cursing me,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.010
so I lied in court.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.340
But after that,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.250
I lived each day in guilt and regret.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.220
Standing here today,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.490
I just want to prove

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.220
that the condom Ye Sibei had
was from me.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.010
I asked her to keep it with her.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.010
It had nothing to do with her.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.140
(Judge)

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.250
I always thought

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.770
Fan Jiancheng

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.340
was a good father

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.940
and a good husband.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.580
So when he made mistakes,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.770
I instinctively stood up

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.010
to protect his image.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.850
I even believed his wrongdoing

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.850
was just a moment of weakness.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.340
But sadly,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.490
I found more evidence.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.010
As I discovered

00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:43.370
more evidence that he hurt
other innocent women,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.980
(Witness)
his image in my mind

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.770
completely collapsed.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.010
He's also a father to a daughter.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.460
How could he do such things?

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220
I'm so disappointed.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.580
I was too naive.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.890
My protection of him

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.220
and everything I did for him

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.220
were all wrong.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.220
If I don't stand up bravely,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.220
more innocent women

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.130
will be hurt.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:24.460
So...

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.850
So I must stop him.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.770
I want to seek justice.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.980
I want to protect the innocent.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.770
I've submitted all the evidence

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.580
to the police.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.010
I hope the court,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.890
will show leniency

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.010
for my past mistakes

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.610
for the sake of my daughter.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.460
Thank you.

(Defense Lawyer)

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.140
(Witness)

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.530
I'm a staff member
from Fuqiang Real Estate.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.370
Tao Jie.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.380
(Legal Representative)

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.770
I was also one of Fan Jiancheng's prey.

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:26.300
(Legal Representative)

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.730
When I first joined the company,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.380
Mr. Fan was kind

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.220
and very caring toward me.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.010
At first,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.755
I thought he treated everyone like that.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.490
So deep down,

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.490
I admired
such a superior like him greatly.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.590
Until one gathering,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.090
where he drank heavily,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.490
crying as he told me

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.420
his life was miserable.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.530
He was unhappy.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.810
Seeing him drunk,

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.290
I offered to take him home.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.530
He told me

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.250
to send him alone to a hotel
for one night.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.220
I trusted him.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.980
I thought I could leave that room,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.530
but I never expected...

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.490
He strangled my neck,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.380
pulled my hair,

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.620
and kept slamming my head
against the wall.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.810
I cried and begged him.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.650
I said...

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.010
I said, "Please let me go."

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.380
But he didn't seem to hear.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.490
I thought I would die.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.490
Then I realized...

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.660
I...

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.220
was completely wrong.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.980
The next day, I ran away.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.180
I thought of going to the police,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.860
but I was too afraid.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.860
(Defendant)
I couldn't even tell my parents.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.220
(Defense Lawyer)
I couldn't explain

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.530
why I drank with him

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.330
and why I took

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.420
a drunk man to a hotel.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.530
I couldn't understand it myself.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.290
So I thought

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.220
I deserved it all.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.250
After that incident,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.660
he promoted me.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.330
My salary doubled.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.260
And

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.250
he treated me even better.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.090
So I trusted him again.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:32.530
(Legal Representative)

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.570
And I kept

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.330
an illicit relationship with him.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.050
Until Ye Sibei's case happened,

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.980
I realized

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.860
his old habits had returned.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.090
At first, I wanted to help him

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.250
cover things up.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.570
But then I understood

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.810
I wasn't helping you.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.860
I was hurting you!

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.220
You're adding insult to injury!

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.733
(Defense Lawyer)
Don't you feel shame?

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:04.220
You jerk.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.290
(Judge)
Maintain courtroom order!

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.488
Your Honor, don't believe her!

00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:08.530
We were just ordinary lovers.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.220
Who said she liked me
and wanted to be with me forever?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.810
Defendant, control your emotions.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.090
Sorry.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.460
(Defense Lawyer)

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.260
(Legal Representative)

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.290
Victim.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.250
You insist it was not voluntary.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.490
At first,

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.810
you had no private contact with him.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.180
(Presiding Judge)
Can you tell me

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.420
why you first stayed silent,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.290
then suddenly chose to accuse

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.250
after such a major trauma?

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.180
Why didn't you
report to the police at the start?

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.980
I had never faced such a thing.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.980
My family told me

00:21:04.044 --> 00:21:05.420
that the wound would reopen again

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.900
if I reported it.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.180
I was afraid,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.730
but it was normal.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.290
Everyone fears the unknown.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.380
I thought of giving up,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.140
but a voice inside asked me,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.660
"Is this really the end?

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.620
Can I really pretend nothing happened?"

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.420
The answer is no.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.330
When I finally took that step,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.180
I faced many hardships.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.940
They were so heavy
that they could crush me.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.220
But I did not give up,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.380
nor did I fall.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.010
Many people supported me

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.220
and encouraged me.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.180
With their greatest kindness,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.420
they protected and defended me.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.180
All rise.

criminal verdict.

(and administered drugs,)

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.010
(forcing sexual relations
with the victim)

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.220
(against her will.)

(The facts are clear,)

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.330
(and the evidence is sufficient.)

(He shall be held criminally liable
for the crime of rape.)

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.620
(Presiding Judge)
Fan Jiancheng raped multiple victims,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.420
which is a serious offense.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.570
He should be severely punished.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.940
To evade punishment, Fan Jiancheng

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.290
instructed his spouse,

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.420
Zhao Shuhui, a third party,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.490
to conceal and forge evidence

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.900
during the first trial,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.660
causing the first court
to declare him not guilty.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.860
This shows he feels no remorse

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.570
for his criminal behavior.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.420
His intent was extremely malicious.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.400
His crime poses great danger to society.

Defendant Fan Jiancheng

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.620
is guilty of illegal drug possession,

Come home to eat later.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.260
Okay.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.340
Sibei, you two go first.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.610
Was today smooth?

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.650
Why are you home later than usual?

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:41.490
It went well.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.900
Fishing moratorium's coming soon,

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.380
so I wanted to stock up more.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.170
Don't. My hands smell like fish.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.210
Hungry?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.700
A little.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.650
Food's ready for you.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.300
It might be a bit cold now.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.900
- I'll reheat them.
- It's fine.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.860
Is the shop busy today?

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.780
Pretty good. We had some regulars.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.050
Tourist season's coming soon.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.380
It'll only get better.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:10.780
Then I'll come home earlier

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.780
to give you a hand.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.420
Granny, have you eaten?

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.460
- I have.
- You have?

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.570
Granny's cooking smells so good.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.860
Is this okay?

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.940
Good, one more shot.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.210
Lemon tea for you two.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:55.210
All our seafood is caught today.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.420
Okay, I'll check.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.444
Prepare the food faster.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.010
Coming up.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.050
Miss,

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.610
can I ask something?

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.260
We've been here for over a week.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.340
Your food is especially delicious.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:04.820
Thanks.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.170
What's your secret?

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.340
Our seafood
is all caught fresh on the day.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.300
My husband goes to sea himself.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.820
- No wonder.
- Qin Nan?

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.170
Is Qin Nan the owner here?

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.210
Yes, my husband.

00:40:16.111 --> 00:40:17.169
Enjoy your meal.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.860
If you enjoy the food,
leave a good review.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.940
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.420
There is no pain you can't overcome

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.170
and despair you can't endure, Ye Sibei.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.460
May I take a look?

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.860
Is Ye Sibei a celebrity?

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.050
No.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.820
- Heard of her?
- No.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:39.980
Ye Sibei

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.860
is my wife.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.210
So he uses your words
as his motto.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.940
You two are so sweet.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.860
So sweet.

00:40:48.355 --> 00:40:49.050
How about this?

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.300
I'll take a photo for you.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.650
I'll also help promote you.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:52.570
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.740
Stand right here.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.740
Take a few more for them.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.420
One, two, three.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.260
(Ordinary World)

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.490
Have you thought of a name for the baby?

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.050
What name do you like? I'll follow you.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.940
Nuannuan.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.340
Nuannuan?

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.130
She kicked me.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.740
She must have heard it.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.300
Nuannuan, did you hear me?

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.340
Nuannuan, keep going strong.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.860
Grow up soon.
