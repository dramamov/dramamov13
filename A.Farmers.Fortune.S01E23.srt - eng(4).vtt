00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.720
You've got quite the nerve,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.760
daring to mock me.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.640
Mom!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.520
Tangbao?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.920
What are you two doing here?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.760
Bad man! Don't you yell at my mom!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Xiaosheng!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.960
The children of country women

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.960
have no manners whatsoever.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.800
And you? Always scolding people!

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.120
Is that what you call manners?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.040
Mom, I'm scared.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.560
Let's go home.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.080
It's alright, sweetheart.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.280
Don't be scared.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
Go home with your brother first.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.880
Daddy and I

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.760
will come back soon, okay?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.280
Then we're not going either.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.240
We want to stay with you and Daddy!

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.880
Fine then.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.920
We'll all stay here,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.400
with Grandpa,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.400
until your father comes back.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520
You think this is a game?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.160
These two kids are so young.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.360
Without adults,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.160
you want them to freeze or starve?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.320
Besides,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.600
don't you love locking people up?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
Two more in,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400
and you're getting a bargain!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.120
Enjoy your meal.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.200
Let's go.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.960
That insolent woman!

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.280
Unbelievable!

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.820
(Quiet Elegance)

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.280
Brother Ruofeng,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.760
please, let me in!

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.660
- No, Tangbao.
- I'm begging you!

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.520
You can't go in there.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.480
Brother Ruofeng.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.840
What are you doing here?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.200
Grandpa!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Mom asked me to bring Dad some food.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.760
You have no father.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.920
Grandpa,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.760
please!

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440
Let Daddy eat,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.040
he's so pitiful

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.880
being locked up.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.880
Please, Grandpa!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.560
I'm begging you!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.920
Please, Grandpa!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.400
Stop crying, Tangbao.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.680
Give it to me.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.040
Thank you, Brother Ruofeng.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.960
You're welcome.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.480
Useless.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.680
No technique at all.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.760
If you keep swinging that sword carelessly,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.840
you'll hurt yourself.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.560
So you know martial arts?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.400
Watch closely.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.040
Grandpa's amazing!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.760
Even better than Dad!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.840
Of course.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.880
I taught your father

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.680
everything he knows.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.040
That sword move just now looked so cool!

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.000
Can you do it again?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120
I want to learn!

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400
Really?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.760
Then watch closely.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.400
- Grandpa!
- To learn swordsmanship,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.760
you have to start with the horse stance.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.320
Come in.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.180
So,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.000
what are you hinting at this time?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.840
This is winter melon and fox nut soup.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.760
It's good for your leg pain.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.600
I heard from Xiaosheng

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.880
that your legs have been bothering you,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440
so I asked Ruofeng about it.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.440
He said you were injured

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.880
years ago on the battlefield,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.280
and you like

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.600
to eat too much meat.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.040
I guessed

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480
it might be gout.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720
This soup

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.440
won't cure it,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.280
but drinking it regularly

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.720
can ease the pain.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920
Petty tricks.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.760
Small favors.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.400
Don't think a little gesture like this

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.600
will make me go soft.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.760
I do hope for my family to be reunited,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.040
but I'm not naïve enough to believe

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.000
you'd let that happen just because of this.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.880
Still, Yanjin has been away

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.920
for so many years,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.720
just treat this

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.040
as a bit of filial piety offered on his behalf.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840
Wait.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160
The border is in crisis now.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840
If you can gather one thousand taels

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.000
within a single day

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.880
to support the army,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.240
I might

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.160
consider reuniting your family.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.000
But

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.720
if you can't,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.200
don't blame me for being heartless.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.480
I'll take Yanjin and leave immediately.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.000
Here's

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.160
all the money our family has, and

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.880
the title deed and secret recipes
of the Fengyang House.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.600
Although I want our family to be together

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.840
and happy again,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.040
this is

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.840
everything we own.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280
Once we hand it over,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.720
we'll go back

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.040
to living dirt poor,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.880
barely scraping by.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.000
And Fengyang House

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.440
will belong to someone else.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.760
This decision affects the future

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.120
of both the Fu family and Fengyang House.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.040
So I can't decide alone.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.440
Today,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.000
we'll all speak our minds.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.440
Should we give up everything we have

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.840
to save Father

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.840
and reunite our family?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.560
General Su.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.440
(Quiet Elegance)

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.000
This is everything we own.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.000
Please take a look.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.120
You're really

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.880
willing to give it all up?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.920
It's a decision my children

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.000
and I made together.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.280
If it means bringing our family back together,

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.120
we'll give everything we have.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.440
General, there's only nine hundred taels.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.680
Time was short.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.000
I'll find the remaining hundred

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.440
as soon as possible.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.760
Please...

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.000
There's no room for negotiation.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm leaving for the capital today.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.160
You'd better stop dreaming.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.320
- General Su!
- From this day on,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.000
you and Yanjin are no longer

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.280
connected in any way.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.560
General Su, please give me a little more...

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.600
General, some villagers are outside.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.800
They're demanding to see He Qingqing.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.800
(Next Episode)
So you really refuse to be Su Yanjin?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.880
You really refuse

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.960
to be my son?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.000
I want to be like you,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.440
to protect my wife and child just as

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.680
you protected me when I was little.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.800
I've found something

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.160
more precious

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.800
than a dream.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.200
I want to become a great general

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.560
to protect Dad, Mom and Tangbao.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.480
I want to be like Mother,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.120
and always stay together.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.320
May those I love

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.360
never drift apart.
