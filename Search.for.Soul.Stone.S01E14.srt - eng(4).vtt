00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.600
Xiao Duo

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.359
Brother

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.079
Xiao Duo

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.159
Xiao Duo

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:06.239
I didn't expect this

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.519
You're actually here

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.680
You escaped back then

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.799
Now you've walked right into my trap

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.200
But that's fine

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200
Taking care of you now

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.599
isn't too late

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.040
Still not enough

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.760
I need a lot more Spiritual Power

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.200
Xiao Duo

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.959
Xiao Duo

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.680
Don't let your emotions control you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.120
Feel the flow and direction of Spiritual Power

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.599
Our Meng Jia doesn't rely on Soulstones

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.520
But all Soulstone Spiritual Power

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.800
can be used by us

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.439
This Spiritual Power

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360
comes from the Soulstones in the factory

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.479
No, it's Meng Yan

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.599
How did you...

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.919
Darn it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.319
That brat interrupted my power

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.199
I knew I shouldn't have kept you

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.919
Only realizing it now

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.120
It's too late

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.199
I advise you

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.560
I advise you not to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.159
Why am I hurt the same way?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.080
Meng Yan

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.439
You really underestimate my power

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.159
If you've got the guts

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.520
Come and hit me here

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.719
Come on

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.120
We

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.839
See you in hell

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:44.079
Who are you?

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:06.560
Who are you?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.959
Why did you save him?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.199
Mr. Shen

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.199
He's still alive, right?

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.800
If he was dead, I wouldn't have brought him

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.199
Madam Tang

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:30.639
How did it end up like this?

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.000
You can ask Shen Jingshi about this later

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.560
Now we're even

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:36.920
Even?

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:41.079
Who gave you the illusion

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.439
that you have the right

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.959
to bargain with me?

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.079
You saved my adopted son

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.360
I let your daughter go

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.199
Sounds fair enough

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.199
The Tang Family does have a daughter

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.839
But what does that have to do with you?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.800
Madam Tang

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.439
Oh, no

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.519
I should call you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.399
Shisan Niang

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.000
Oh, what's going on now?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.959
This is so strange

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.160
Shisan Niang

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.639
Go inside and try to calm them down

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.639
Madam and Master are arguing again

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.800
What's happened now?

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.959
Mr. Tang is fooling around outside again

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.240
That woman even came to the house to challenge today

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.399
Good thing Zhang and I were here

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.360
Madam just gave birth

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:44.680
She'll definitely suffer again

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:47.920
Believe it or not, I'll make sure

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.439
you can't leave today

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.879
Who do you think you are?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.959
I asked Yinghong to fetch something for me

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.199
Not only did you insult her

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.600
you even kicked her out

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.959
Do you think I have no shame?

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.439
You think I don't know

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.240
what's going on between you and her?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800
You sneak around with her outside

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.920
I've put up with it

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.399
But today she came here to challenge me

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.360
You've really gone too far

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.279
Too far?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.800
Let me show you something worse

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.680
Can't even give birth to a son

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.959
Aren't you ashamed?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.439
Sir

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.519
And you dare say I'm too much

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:28.199
Sir

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.560
Sir

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.680
Madam just finished her confinement

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.800
You...

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:35.160
Madam, please say less

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:38.519
Isn't your daughter your child too?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.240
What's the use of that good-for-nothing?

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.959
My business has been bad for years

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.720
It's all because of you, jinx

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.639
You bring me bad luck

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:47.439
And you

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:47.959
Get out

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.759
You, jinx, cursing me

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:52.600
Cursing me

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.519
You curse me

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.560
How dare you, a mere servant

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.399
People like you

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.279
don't deserve to live in this world

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.759
Servants never care who the master is

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.559
A master is just a set of clothes

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.600
Whoever puts it on

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.399
becomes the master of this house

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.600
Head of the family

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.440
As for what's beneath the clothes

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.879
Whether it's Madam Tang or Shisan Niang

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.960
It makes little difference to them

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.399
But

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.039
for Tang Yuyan

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.879
it's a whole different story

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.799
This has been hidden for twenty years

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:09.039
If Tang Yuyan finds out

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:12.399
you're not her real mother

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.039
but also the one who killed her father

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.480
what will she think?
