(The Choice)

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.399
What's on your mind, darling?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.799
Come home with me for a visit.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.399
Sure.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.799
This is my greenhouse.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.200
This

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
is a gardenia.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.400
Before it blooms in midsummer,
it needs plenty of water.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.040
After it blooms,

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.560
you should water it less.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.640
This flower

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.959
is called a hydrangea.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.159
It loves shade and avoids sun.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.159
It likes moisture but not flooding.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.959
It needs frequent watering,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.079
but never too much at once.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.480
This flower

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.159
is my favorite.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.560
It's called forget-me-not.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.000
Because even in winter,

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.879
it still blooms,

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.640
making it the most resilient flower.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080
Are you're telling me all this

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.599
because you want me
to help you take care of them?

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.280
I just wanted to show you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.039
my favorite flowers.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.080
Besides, with me around,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.240
why would I need your help?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm more than willing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.039
to be your gardener.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.800
Then let me test you.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.879
The hydrangea I mentioned,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.400
how should you tend to it?

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.360
I knew you didn't memorize it.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.599
When we get back tonight,

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.599
I'll write down all the flowers

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.840
in a notebook.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.639
You'd better memorize them.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.039
Looks like to win your heart,

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.319
I need to

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.759
be dedicated.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.240
You smooth talker.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.159
I recognize this flower.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.159
Magnolia.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.759
The flower language of magnolia is

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.599
pure and sincere love.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.840
When the magnolia blooms,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.400
you're the only one in my eyes.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.680
So it's only a matter of time

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.879
until the fall of Wujian.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.639
A century ago,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the First Master foresaw this disaster.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.199
So he put the Chi and Mei pearls
into two humans.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.240
That way, you and Li Motong

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.800
could draw strength from them.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.200
And more importantly,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.040
so that the two of you

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.000
could unite to save the day.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.040
So Li Motong and I

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:30.040
were nothing but Father's pawns.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.759
Does he know?

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.680
Now, for Miss Lu's sake,

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.160
Li Motong
is willing to give up his life,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
refusing to take the Mei pearl.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.839
All I can do is take a bet

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.759
on whether Lu Huayan
would sacrifice herself for Li Motong

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.040
and remove the Mei pearl.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.759
So…

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.000
who will truly save Wujian?

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.879
Boss.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.319
Have you found them?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120
I've searched everywhere,

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.120
but still no sign.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
Work harder on the search.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.879
Search the whole city.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.720
Boss, where are you going?

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.399
(If the Mei pearl stays within you,)

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.279
(he can't return to Wujian.)

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.120
(Not only will he die,)

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.120
(but the Wujian will perish as well.)

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.879
(But I believe
you have the right to know)

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.519
(and the right to choose.)

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.560
Let go!

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:29.879
Let go!

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.600
I won't.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.399
Let go!

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:32.319
I said no!

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.360
Lu Huayan.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.879
Why would you

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.160
sacrifice your life for me?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.279
You've always been
the one protecting me.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.319
Let me protect you just this once.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.720
Please, let me protect you for once!

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.360
Lu Huayan.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.759
I only wish for you to live well.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.319
But I can't

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.680
use your life

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.680
to buy my own meaningless survival.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.279
If only one of us can live,

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.959
I want it to be you.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:10.720
Lu Huayan!

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.519
You once said

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.680
one must live for himself.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.800
You could do it.

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.160
And you still can do it.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.160
But since the moment I met you,

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.079
I'm no longer Lu Huayan!

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:25.800
And I'm no longer Li Motong!

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.600
Lu Huayan.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.720
I just want you to live.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
If you're gone,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.759
what am I supposed to do?

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.879
You must live well.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.560
But…

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.160
You're from Wujian,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.480
and I'm from the human world.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.120
We're from different worlds, yet our love remains.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.519
Our meeting
was destined to be a mistake.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.680
No.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:05.879
It wasn't a mistake.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.600
Li Motong.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.920
Just let me protect you this once.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.519
I want you to live.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:18.879
I told you.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.959
I don't need it.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.120
Just stay here.

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.360
You're not going anywhere.
