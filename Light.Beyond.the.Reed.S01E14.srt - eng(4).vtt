00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.850
Mom.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.890
Mom, you're awake.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.410
Leave

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.250
Nancheng...

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.060
Leave

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.730
Nancheng...

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.120
Go...

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.250
Go...

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.220
(Warning: Radiation.
Do not enter when the light is on.)

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.820
Don't worry.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.450
They're just taking a scan.

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:49.920
The doctors inside will look after her.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.620
Come.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.660
Sit for a bit.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.900
Sibei.

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:10.380
About your mom's hospital stay,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.610
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.900
If she wants you
to go to the provincial capital,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.740
you should go.

00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:20.900
I'll handle things here.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.170
With Mom like this,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.020
I can't leave.

00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:29.610
You don't trust me
to take care of her, do you?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.820
Well...

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.330
You're right.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.420
All these years,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.220
I've never done anything

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.688
that could make you feel at ease.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.010
Not once.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.420
Sibei.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.290
When you were born,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.490
I was the one who urged your mom

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.340
to send you to the countryside.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.490
All these years,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.020
you've always thought your mom
was against you in everything,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.220
blamed you for everything,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.170
and favored Nianwen

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.010
over you.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.460
But the truth behind it all...

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.410
It was because of me.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.580
Your mom's illness

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.820
made me suddenly

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.490
realize a lot of things.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.688
I used to blame her for her temper.

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:43.850
But someone
who had to feed the whole family...

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.410
If she weren't strong-willed,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.410
how could we have lived
the life we have now?

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.460
I've wronged your mom.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.690
And I've wronged you.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.540
You've suffered too much because of me.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.220
Dad, stop talking.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.140
It's time.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.250
This family

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:11.850
needs me to take responsibility too.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.770
As a husband,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.420
as a father,

00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:19.266
I've been absent for too long.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.250
Sibei,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.930
listen to your mom.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:24.570
Go to the provincial capital.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.410
Start a new life there.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.540
I'm here.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.210
Dad's here.

00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:32.250
Don't worry.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.940
(Ye Sibei achieved first-tier university
score in first mock exam of Year Three)

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.460

as encouragement)

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.020

- Please keep your receipt. Next.
- Thank you.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.890
Hello, I'd like to renew bed 219.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.730
How much is it?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.530
You still need to pay 3,800 yuan.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.060
Can you hurry up?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.460
Sorry,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.420
just a moment.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.940
Come on, hurry up.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.820
Right away.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.650
Hello, 3,800 yuan.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.730
Here.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.440
Is it done?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.650
Total amount 4,000 yuan.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.580
Extra two.

00:10:09.244 --> 00:10:10.650
- Please keep your receipt.
- Thank you.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.490
Next.

Hello, Nan.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.460
Hey, Nianwen.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.300
Where's your sister?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.220
She went to collect Mom's CT results.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.850
Alright, got it.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.340
What a coincidence, Sibei.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.530
I'm here with my wife for a check-up.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.130
I heard your mom's unwell, right?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.650
Is she feeling any better lately?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.370
Oh, yes.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.820
Do you need money?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.580
If you're short on money,
you must tell me.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.220
If you're struggling,
I'll help you however I can.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.130
Please leave.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.460
Get out.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.660
Honey,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.370

Welcome to Fan's livestream,

new and old friends alike.
Hello, everyone.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.530
Fan welcomes you all.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.530
If you're new here,
tap that little red heart.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.650
Give me a follow, too.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.250
Today, I'm bringing you

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.600
these adorable fortune cats again.

(That's right, you guessed it.
It brings romance and good fortune.)

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.180
(We've got five thousand total today.)

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.820
(Everyone, raise your lucky right hand,)

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.980
(give it a wave,)

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.130
(and place your orders quickly!)

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.890
(That's right, just like that.)

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.770
Officer,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.250
I already told you last time.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.890
That woman drank a lot that night.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.770
Nothing else unusual happened.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.730
Did any of you hand her water?

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.490
Or see her drinking any?

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.460
We weren't in the room the whole time,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.980
but we didn't give her water.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.940
Manager Yang,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.370
when we took your statement last time,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.100
I remember there were
three waiters present,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.850
right?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.610
Yes.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.340
Then why are there only two today?

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.580
Where's the other one?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.220
She's resigned.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.530
Resigned?

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.340
Yes.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.420
When was that?

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.610
Shortly after that incident happened.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.130
She said she found a better job.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.340
Do you know where she is now?

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:39.460
Meili, these officers
would like a word with you.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.770
I'm sorry,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.340
we'll just need a bit of your time.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:42.730
It's fine.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.570
Please, have a seat.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.980
We

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.010
went to your previous workplace.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.130
They said you'd changed jobs.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.220
Why did you move here?

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.730
There's this lady.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.580
She thought I was quite capable at work,

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.300
so she introduced me to this place.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.890
The environment's better here,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.100
and the pay's higher, too.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.610
Right, that's fair.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.610
Who's this lady?

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.820
Ms. Tao.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.130
She was at that dinner, too.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.850
Show her the photo.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.690
Is this her?

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.850
Yes.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.580
Tao Jie, right?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.010
Have you known her long?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.340
No.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.730
Then why did she
recommend you for a job?

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.220
She came by the shop
to chat with me one day.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.890
She said we got along well.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.730
Then we realized
we were from the same hometown,

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.220
so she helped me find this job.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.130
Same hometown, huh?

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:28.770
Yes.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.100
Ah, hometown ties.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.220
That explains it.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.100
Where are you from?

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.940
Zhi County.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.060
Zhi County.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.340
You're here because

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.610
of that case, aren't you?

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.220
Let me ask you,

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.100
the night Ms. Ye got drunk,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.220
did anyone give her water?

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.980
Yes, I did.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.420
What's wrong? Don't scare me.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.420
It's fine. Relax.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.530
Just tell us the truth.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.060
Did you pour that glass
of water yourself?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.660
No.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.420
After Ms. Ye vomited that night,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.980
she looked really uncomfortable,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.100
and Mr. Fan
handed me a glass of water.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.980
Waiter.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:19.940
Yes, Sir?

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.220
Do me a favor.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.580
Take this glass of water
to my colleague.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.010
She's had a bit too much to drink.
The one in the coat.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.580
It'll help her sober up.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.420
Alright.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.260
Thank you.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.080
Water.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.580
Miss, would you like some water?

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.420
Have a drink.

00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:43.890
So it was Mr. Fan
who handed you the water?

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.090
Fan Jiancheng?

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.210
Yes.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.060
Captain Chen, in that drug case
you're investigating,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.010
is there anyone from Nancheng

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.088
on the list of registered buyers
of that medicine?

00:17:01.577 --> 00:17:03.190
Alright, let me know
if anything comes up.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.250
Okay, thanks.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.290
Check if Fan Jiancheng has any record

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.940
of purchasing controlled drugs.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.020
Got it.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.340
(Shop for Transfer)

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.460
Nan,

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.380
everything's ready.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.090
You and your wife are really leaving?

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.380
Starting over somewhere new.

00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:40.733
You've canceled the memberships, right?

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.010
I've found a few repair shops for you.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.250
They're all run by my friends.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.660
The only thing is, they're a bit far.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.810
It might be inconvenient
for your commute.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.620
But the business is good,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.490
and the pay's higher.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.420
You can pick whichever you like.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.380
Choose one that suits you.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.660
I wanted to take over the shop,

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.666
but I don't have enough money.

00:18:05.844 --> 00:18:07.490
I've scraped some together
from my family,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.010
and borrowed from friends,
but it's still not enough.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.850
How much short?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.020
Thirty thousand.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.900
Nan, can you wait for me?

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.180
I'll borrow some more
when I go home for Chinese New Year.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.290
No need.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.422
Forget the thirty thousand.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.530
That's not right.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.220
You've been with me for so long.

00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:25.266
Do you think I'd care
about thirty thousand yuan?

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.530
All I want

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.660
is for you to look after it.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.180
It's my hard work over all these years.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.940
Don't worry, Nan.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.530
I don't even know what to say.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.940
You and your wife

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.620
- need money the most right now...
- Enough.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.090
If we're buddies, don't make a fuss.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.060
Thanks, Nan.

00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:52.050
Then treat that thirty thousand
as your share.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.420
Let's leave on the first of next month.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.810
That soon?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.380
You don't want to go?

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.620
No.

00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:11.250
I'm just worried it'll be hard for you.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.660
Maybe wait
until Mom recovers before leaving.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.380
Nianwen's still at home anyway.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.250
We can start packing bit by bit.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.810
It's not that far.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.940
We can come back often.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.610
Alright.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.530
Once we've settled down,

00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:25.380
we can bring Mom to stay with us.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.250
I warmed you some milk.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.940
It'll help you sleep.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.660
You haven't been resting well lately.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.090
Alright.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.380
It's late. Wash up and get some sleep.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.810
(Alright, here we go.)

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.900
(Welcome, everyone,
to Fan's livestream.)

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.220
(Thanks for joining us.)

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.980
(Raise your lucky left hand,)

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.010
(wave it, shake it.)

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.010
(Wave and shake your right hand, too.)

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.955
(Do you know what that means?
I'll tell you.)

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.810
(Follow the host for more perks)
(Wave it high, and shake it.)

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.010
(Hurry and place your orders.)

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.810
(That's right. Just like that.)

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.620
(Everyone type six-six-six in the chat.)

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.730
(Girl, don't tease me.)

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.810
(I'll tell everyone,)

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.860
(whoever raises their right hand,)

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.420
(the right hand, this one,)

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.290
(and waves it like this,)

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.420
(that's the male cat.)

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.420
(What does it mean?)

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.530
(Wealth and treasure!)

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.050
(Fortune flows from all directions.)

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.050
(And when it raises its lucky left hand)

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.220
(and waves it to everyone,)

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.770
(what does that mean?)

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.490
(It means building good connections.)

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.770
(Perfect for any kind of shop)

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.490
(whether you're in food service...)

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.460
Don't watch that.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.250
Why are you watching him?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.740
You're up.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.220
That's strange today.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.530
Why did I sleep so long?

00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:45.010
You didn't even wake me up.

00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:47.420
Didn't matter. There wasn't much to do.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.644
Might as well sleep more.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.090
I need to go tidy up the shop today.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.250
And give our car a full check.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.820
These next few days,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.220
shouldn't we go to the provincial city

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.140
to look at houses?

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.980
Sure.

00:22:01.044 --> 00:22:02.530
Why are your dark circles so heavy?

00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:04.420
Didn't sleep well last night?

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.220
I slept fine, though.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.620
Go wash up.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.620
Breakfast's soon.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.570
Nan.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.690
Let me do it.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:46.860
- I'll do it.
- It's fine.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.700
I'll do it myself.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.050
No, let me.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.250
Let me serve you one last time.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.010
Sounds like I'm not coming back.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.250
You've got packing to do,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.530
and plenty at home to handle.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.050
I've got this.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.860
After this, I'll check
all four-wheel alignment

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.810
and everything for you.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.140
- Don't worry.
- Alright.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.288
Make sure to fill up the tank.

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:03.730
I've got a long drive tomorrow.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.860
Got it, don't worry.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.250
Ms. Tao, where are you going later?

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.980
I've no time for fun.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.490
I'm picking up my kid soon.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:21.466
Where are you two off to?

00:23:21.488 --> 00:23:22.810
We're going to catch a film.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.770
There seem to be
quite a few new ones lately.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.220
Recommend me a good one later.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.900
Sure.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.620
We'll get going then.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.530
Alright, take care.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:30.600
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.730
Master.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.570
She's out.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.250
You...

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.050
Sorry about that.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.250
It's you.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.250
Captain Zhang, are you alright?

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.090
I'm fine.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.330
Didn't actually bump me.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.250
It gave me a fright.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.490
It also scared me half to death.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.050
You scared me, and I scared you.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.570
What are you doing here?

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.620
Just handling some work nearby.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.050
Happened to pass through.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.900
You're off work or out on business?

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.010
Off work.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.066
Going to pick up my child.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.010
Did you finish work this early?

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.733
Finished everything early today,
so I left.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.060
Well...

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:19.890
Uh...

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.730
I remember you're
the finance director, right?

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.770
Yes, finance director.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.420
So, when you joined there,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.730
you were already the director?

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.420
Or did you work your way up?

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.570
I worked my way up little by little.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.220
Impressive.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.250
Promoted to finance director
in just four years.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.730
You're a local, right?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.180
Yes, I'm from Nancheng.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.140
What's your relationship
with Fan Jiancheng?

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.810
Mr. Fan and I have no private contact.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.050
Only work matters.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.620
Is Wu Meili a relative of yours?

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.690
Who?

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.650
Wu Meili.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.300
Wu Meili...

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.380
You mean Meili?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.220
Yes.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.140
She's a distant relative of mine.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.900
What about her?

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.380
Nothing, just came to mind.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.980
Just asking.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.050
No worries.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.620
It's nothing?

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.380
People say
you've treated her pretty well, right?

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.460
That's only right.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.620
Captain Zhang,
I've got to go pick up my kid.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.290
- Alright, go ahead.
- Alright.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.460
- I'm fine.
- I'll be off then.

00:25:26.466 --> 00:25:27.290
Nice car you've got.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.810
Bought on a loan.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.460
Drive safe.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.860
Did you two
know each other long before that?

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.530
She came to the shop
to chat with me last time.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.290
She said we really clicked.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.250
Then, we found out
we were from the same place.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.570
So she introduced me here.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.810
Where are you both from?

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:52.650
From Zhi County.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.820
Zhi County.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:58.610
Master.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.930
Well?

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.620
That Tao Jie

00:26:04.111 --> 00:26:05.530
is definitely hiding something.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.260
Here.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.890
What about yours?

00:26:33.977 --> 00:26:35.177
I've already finished mine.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:44.050
I'm going to shower.

00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:02.400
(Nancheng Pharmaceuticals)

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.330
Why did I sleep so long again?

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.060
You're awake?

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.860
It's been strange lately, really.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.290
How can I sleep that long?

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.770
I usually wake up around 6 AM.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.530
Sleeping more's not bad.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.220
You've been too tired recently.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.400
But didn't we agree

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.250
to go to the provincial city
to see houses today?

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.620
I've already made the appointment.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.860
Let's get ready and go.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.770
Dad called and said Mom wants soup.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.155
I need to simmer it for six hours.

00:28:01.177 --> 00:28:02.155
You go by yourself.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.220
That's a big decision.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.290
Can I really decide alone?

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.620
I trust your judgment.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:08.890
Alright, then.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:10.530
Breakfast's on the table.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.460
Eat it while it's hot.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.650
Hello, Jun?

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.250
Didn't I tell you to fill up the tank?

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.050
Why's it only half full?

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.220
I did fill it completely.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.460
The receipt's still in the car.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.740
Got it.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.300
Hello?

00:29:03.355 --> 00:29:05.530
Hey, Sir. The moving boxes
you ordered have arrived.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.530
I'm at your door.

00:29:06.822 --> 00:29:08.330
Alright, just leave them by the door.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.220
Someone's home.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.844
I've been knocking for ages,
but no one answered.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.220
No one's there?

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.140
My wife said
she was staying home to make soup.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:19.730
Well, I've been knocking
for a while, but still no answer.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.220
I'll leave them at the door.
I've got more deliveries to make.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.290
Okay, got it.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.220
Leave them there.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.660
(Sibei)

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.290
Sibei.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.300
Sibei.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.380
Sibei.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.820
Hello, Nianwen?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.380
Is your sister at the hospital?

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.980
No, why?

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.820
What's wrong, Nan?

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.140
Nothing.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.060
Master.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.010
Tao Jie and Fan Jiancheng
really are having an affair.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.370
Who are we targeting?

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.730
Fan Jiancheng, of course.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.460
Slow down.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.060
Ye Sibei.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:51.810
What are you doing here?

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.220
I came to buy some bread.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.010
Captain Zhang, are you on a case?

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:59.220
No, just passing by.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.060
Passing by.

00:32:00.844 --> 00:32:01.980
Alright, I'll let you work.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.050
I'll head over there.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.220
Sure, take care.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.330
You're back.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.050
When did you get home?

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.380
Just now.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.570
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.290
My phone ran out of battery.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.380
Where did you go?

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.380
To the hospital.

00:32:57.177 --> 00:32:58.290
You haven't eaten, right?

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.220
I'll cook for you.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.010
You forgot to drink this.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:48.620
What about yours?

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.530
I've finished mine.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.890
Qin Nan.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.370
Qin Nan.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.300
Qiang.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.210
Mr. Fan.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.650
Mr. Wang, luck's on your side tonight.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.260
Not bad, up two hundred thousand today.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.100
Take care.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.660
Mr. Wang.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:26.210
You're too kind.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.466
Keep it for the lads to have tea.

00:39:27.488 --> 00:39:28.090
Alright, then.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.570
Take care. Come again soon.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.380
Three sides top.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.420
Four sides blow.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.170
- Nine.
- Nine.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.170
Three sides!

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.010
Dealer's call.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.990
Three sides.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.860
No joke.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.780
Sir, you're brilliant.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.210
No more bets.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.700
Five fives.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.090
The player opens one card.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.660
Six fives.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.340
Oh, come on.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.660
No more bets.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.740
- The dealer draws.
- Open one card.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.220
That's a good one.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.300
First time here.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.490
No five points.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.533
The dealer has five points.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.620
Turn to the player.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.620
Nine up.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.260
- Got nine.
- Yes.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.050
Four times.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:44.850
Triple payout!

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.340
Why's your luck so bad?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.600
If you're that good, come and try.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.780
Why is your body so cold?

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.780
I was reading outside just now.
Didn't wear enough.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.260
Go to sleep.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.450
Sibei.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.570
Next month
we'll move to the provincial city.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.820
Start our life over.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.980
We'll have a wonderful future.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.660
I know.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.090
You and me...

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.460
We'll all

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.010
have a great future.
