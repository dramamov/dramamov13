(If You Don't Fight,
You Become Prey for Others' Blades!)

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.000
Concubine Yun has arrived!

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:24.256
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.960
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.240
Where's Chief Wu?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.864
Your Highness,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.360
Chief Wu

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.480
has blood on his hands.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.120
Right now,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.760
he's probably washing them.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.448
Blood on his hands?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.856
What do you mean?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.440
I dare not speculate.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.320
Your Highness should ask him.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200
You'd better know what you're saying.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.720
If I find out you're spouting nonsense,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.880
you'll pay for it.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.832
You all wait here.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.728
Wu Linfu,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.200
I know you're inside. Open up!

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.000
Open the door!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.456
Open up!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.880
Open it...

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.752
(Qinglu Hall)

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.936
I'll go get some wine.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.136
Stop.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.840
I told you to stop!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.000
Who are you really?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.560
I am

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:51.560
Wu Linfu.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.800
I'll ask one last time.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.912
Who

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.544
are you?

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.640
I am Wu Linfu,
Chief of the Fourteen Bureaus.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.248
Bi Da,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.600
don't you recognize me, your sister?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.736
I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.280
don't understand your words.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.760
My brother Bi Da

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.120
has a scar on his lower back.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.600
He got it climbing a tree

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.040
to retrieve my kite

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.080
when he fell
and scraped himself as a child.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.680
I saw it that day.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.600
You have a scar on your lower back too.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.400
You must be mistaken.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.760
I have no such scar.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.336
Is that so?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
Then let me see.

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:03.280
Bi Da,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.200
what are you doing?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.400
Don't do this, Bi Da.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.680
Don't you want to see my body?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680
Let me show you.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.600
Are you insane?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.800
I am His Majesty's consort!

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.832
I don't care!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
Let me go!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.680
Let me go!

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm your sister!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.840
But I never wanted to be your brother.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.144
Are you hurt?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.544
You're bleeding.

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:33.472
It's nothing.

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:34.320
Just a minor injury.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.440
That was dangerous.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.080
Don't take such risks again.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.120
From now on, let me protect you.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.200
Why?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.480
Because I'm your elder sister.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.040
You're not my real sister.

I've become like this...

Do you know

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.280
I've been searching for you all along?

but you were gone.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.240
Consort Jing told me

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.520
she saved you

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.280
and brought you here.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.400
Yes.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.120
Consort Jing later adopted me

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.600
and brought me here.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.864
Don't worry.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.400
I've lived decently these years.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.088
No hardships to speak of.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.704
That's good.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.352
Promise me

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.320
we'll never be apart again.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.256
Okay?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But as I am now,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.120
there's no turning back.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.600
What exactly happened?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800
The eunuchs mentioned

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.752
"blood on your hands."

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.440
What have you done?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.792
Stop asking.

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:10.000
Did Consort Jing

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840
force you?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.560
Stop now.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.600
It's too late.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.520
From the moment
you became His Majesty's woman,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.680
I lost any chance of turning back.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.200
Why did you tell her

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.336
I'm her brother?

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.360
You came here about Concubine Yun again?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.960
I heard she's been looking
for her brother lately.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.000
Seems she succeeded.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.200
Is Your Highness afraid to admit it now?

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.480
You've repeatedly
saved Concubine Yun from peril.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.440
She's clever enough

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280
to deduce

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.920
that you're her long-lost brother.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.560
Shouldn't your sibling reunion

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.080
be a joyous occasion?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.320
Your Highness,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.400
let me remind you.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.480
If you spare her,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.960
all matters can be settled.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.120
But if you harm
a single hair on her head,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.040
I'll show no mercy
for former affections.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.440
You know exactly

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800
what I'm capable of.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.880
Very well.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.600
Good for you, Wu Linfu.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.800
You dare threaten me

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.640
for her sake?

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.640
I have said my piece.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.608
I'll take my leave.

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:14.200
May endless fortune

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.296
bless Your Highness.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.832
You're here.

00:08:17.824 --> 00:08:18.800
Your Highness,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.000
Wu Linfu is innocent.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.120
I insisted on overthrowing Consort Wan,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.280
forcing him to help.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.760
I beg you to spare Wu Linfu

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.120
and keep him out of harem conflicts.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.760
Innocent?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
In this palace,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.680
none are truly innocent.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.480
We simply sacrifice what we can

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.560
in exchange for what we desire.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.384
Your Highness,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.320
this matter between us

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.480
needn't involve someone else.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.720
Involve someone else?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.280
You truly know nothing?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.800
Everything he's done

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.800
has been for your sake.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.280
For my sake?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.520
If it weren't for protecting you

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.400
and wanting me
to offer Zhao Yanwan's indenture,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.240
why else would Wu Linfu
serve me willingly?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.600
He believed Consort Wan
forced blood from you

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.000
and was heartbroken.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.360
To help overthrow her,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.320
he demanded her indenture from me.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.240
My condition was

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.320
his unconditional obedience,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.200
becoming my loyal servant

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.200
bound to me forever.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.320
I've misjudged you all along.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.760
You've hidden your depths well.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.960
In this treacherous palace,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.320
you must fight.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.680
If you don't fight, you become prey

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.200
for others' blades.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.320
To control your fate,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.600
it requires a sharp blade at hand.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.624
Don't you agree?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.560
And Wu Linfu

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.760
makes the perfect blade.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.280
What will free him from your grasp?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.800
Lately in the palace,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.240
Noble Lady Mu gains prominence.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.120
Her rising status displeases me.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.040
I understand.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.760
Your Majesty,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760
it is time to choose.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.152
Not tonight.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.776
Wait.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.640
Concubine Yun's plaque reappears?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.360
Your Majesty,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.120
Concubine Yun has recovered from illness

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.680
and resumed palace duties.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.920
I

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.520
restored her plaque accordingly.

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:49.728
(Noble Lady Rong, Concubine Shen, Attendant Li,
Consort Jing, Concubine Yun, Concubine Shu)

00:10:49.728 --> 00:10:50.624
(Concubine Yun)
To Yongxiu Palace.

00:10:50.707 --> 00:10:51.744
At once.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.456
Your Ladyship,

00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:01.120
come catch me.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.040
Ming Yue.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.920
Over here.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.840
Stay still.

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:08.120
De Gui.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.080
Where are you?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.080
Over here.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.480
- Is that Noble Lady Mu?
- Ming Yue.

00:11:14.784 --> 00:11:15.760
I caught you.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.672
Your Majesty,

00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:17.856
it's Noble Lady Mu.

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:19.808
Where are you?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.112
Ming Yue,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.240
I heard your voice.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.048
Don't run.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.040
Over here.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.080
Ming Yue?

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.640
Ming Yue?

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.280
I got you.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.360
Look at me.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.472
Over here.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.680
I got you!

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.280
How about I play hide-and-seek with you?

00:11:52.672 --> 00:11:54.208
(Noble Lady Mu)
Your Majesty!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Hide-and-seek?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.200
That's so you!

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.040
As a child,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.080
I played it with eunuchs.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.840
It's been ages.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.520
I never expected you

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.600
to retain such childlike innocence.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.200
If Your Majesty doesn't mind,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.240
how about joining me

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840
and reliving childhood memories?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.680
Okay.

00:12:16.884 --> 00:12:19.008
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.176
Your Ladyship!

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.776
Your Ladyship.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.952
Where is His Majesty?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.680
His Majesty went to Noble Lady Mu's.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.896
Noble Lady Mu?

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:29.800
Yes.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.520
His Majesty was originally coming here.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.720
He was stopped midway by Noble Lady Mu.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.760
Noble Lady Mu truly is a temptress.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.720
She's enchanted His Majesty completely.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.224
Who knows

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.520
what tricks she's using?

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.120
Chengxi Palace
is truly auspicious ground.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720
There was Consort Wan.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
Now it's Noble Lady Mu.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.016
Your Ladyship,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.160
they say Noble Lady Mu

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.600
is very unruly.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920
If this continues,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.800
His Majesty
will never leave Chengxi Palace.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.320
We must devise a plan quickly.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.880
Noble Lady Mu
currently enjoys imperial favor.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.640
Direct confrontation with her

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.320
would gain us no advantage.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.200
By the way, Your Ladyship.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.320
I've recently heard

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.800
Chengxi Palace has peculiar news.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.200
What is it?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.120
They say His Majesty

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.480
permitted Noble Lady Mu
to keep a horse in Chengxi Palace.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.160
Now they do horse training
day and night there.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.632
Horse training?

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:28.160
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.440
Your Ladyship.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.432
Your Ladyship.

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:31.936
I've had news.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.600
His Majesty
went to Chengxi Palace again?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.640
Yes.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.920
Your Highness predicts divinely.

00:13:36.352 --> 00:13:37.280
What trick

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.720
did Noble Lady Mu use this time

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.160
to intercept His Majesty again?

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.560
What else?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.600
Horse training.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.640
They say she gifted His Majesty
a horsewhip

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.520
and a saddle.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.440
At night,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.680
His Majesty's horse-training commands
echo from Chengxi Palace.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.160
What breed of horse

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.040
has so captivated His Majesty?

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.000
Concubine Yun has arrived!

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.760
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.800
My sudden visit

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.000
must trouble you.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.280
Nonsense.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.520
The harem praises your unmatched wisdom.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.520
I'm fortunate to bask in your presence.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.160
How could I not rejoice?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.920
I heard today

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.960
you gifted His Majesty a Ferghana horse.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.920
I'm deeply curious.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.720
How can one

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.200
ride a horse in the harem?

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.000
Thus,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.920
I came to witness this marvel.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320
Please wait.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.840
Your Highness,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.880
today, will you be the horse tamer

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.680
or

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.280
the wild steed to be tamed?
