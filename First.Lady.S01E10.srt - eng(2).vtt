ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:45.066
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:39.537
I invited you here today
because there's been a lot of buzz lately.

00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:45.335
It's always good to be careful.

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:54.552
Be careful.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:56.638
It's hot.

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.688
Shabu-shabu is a combat ration, you know.

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:09.651
I wanted to treat you to this good food
so you could keep up

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.236
your fighting spirit.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.571
That's why I picked

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.114
this dish.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:19.118
Chairman Yang,

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:22.747
you're so well-versed in food.

00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:25.750
Oh, not just food.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.087
As you fill your stomach,
you need a good drink too.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.131
I brought some wine
to enjoy with the meal.

00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:34.801
You can have one bottle each.

00:02:44.894 --> 00:02:46.145
Here you go.

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:50.483
I'm sorry.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.737
You scan it and see.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.280
It's a special vintage wine.

00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:58.908
I sure love food and drinks,

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:01.077
but my specialty is money math, you know.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.328
150,000,000 KRW DEPOSITED

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:06.457
Please make good use of it in your work.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.293
Well…

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:13.131
I don't know if I should accept this.

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.090
Me neither.

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:17.468
It's under

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.972
your drivers' names,

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:22.557
so don't worry about security.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:26.936
I'm terrible with wine.

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:30.356
I'm going to get drunk today.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.861
Come on. You drink to get drunk,

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:37.739
and you fight to win.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.452
The special investigation committee
has been formed with our people,

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:43.745
but the problem is

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:44.912
the president-elect.

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.372
An illegitimate child?

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:48.916
This is a national disgrace.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.918
It's a blow to our national dignity.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:53.796
It is deeply humiliating.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.050
He keeps bringing the special act
to the fore,

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:01.512
thinking he could just smooth things over,
but we can't just sit back and watch.

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:05.058
You must step up and hold him accountable.

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.853
There are discussions going on

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.940
within the party and the Assembly.

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:16.652
But

00:04:16.736 --> 00:04:20.031
the inauguration is in less than a month.

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:23.451
Finish your glass.
Let me pour you another one.

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:28.998
The inauguration is coming soon?

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.169
A president chosen by the people?

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:37.006
We can always elect a new president.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.093
Rules? We can make new ones.

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:41.928
Gosh, you guys!

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.475
You're not rule-followers! You make rules!

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:51.938
Actually,

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.817
we do make laws.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.068
Right.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.278
That's what I'm talking about!

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.407
Don't let the rules hold you back.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.201
Just make the new rules
to drag Hyun Min-cheol down.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:06.285
Then that'll be it.

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:15.503
God damn it.

00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:21.676
YANG HOON

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:41.279
YANG HOON

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.701
I'll do it.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.494
The paternity test.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.582
On one condition, though.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:56.294
I want you to stop bothering me or U-yeong

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.546
regarding the necklace.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.341
I get what you're asking for,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.302
but let me make this clear.

00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:07.680
You're the one who stole the necklace

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.892
and started this bothersome drama.

00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.812
I know.

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:19.734
Which is why I don't want it
to be more bothersome.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.196
If the test results prove you right--

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.280
Then what?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.909
Are you worried I might ask for more?

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:30.828
What more would you ask for?
It just means it's the truth.

00:06:31.704 --> 00:06:32.538
What?

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:35.875
What were you going to ask for?

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:37.668
Money?

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:39.253
Or…

00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.380
recognizing you

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:42.632
as family?

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:45.426
If I ask you to do that,

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:46.802
will you?

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.680
Does my recognition matter?

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:51.265
We're unrelated anyway.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.558
What about with Mr. Hyun?

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:56.812
And Ji-yu?

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:03.527
-You want to be her sister?
-Can't I?

00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:08.074
Ji-yu said it was lonely
being an only child

00:07:08.157 --> 00:07:10.243
and wanted to have an older sister.

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:12.578
Are you being serious right now?

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.334
Was it your plan

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.419
all along?

00:07:21.796 --> 00:07:23.673
Entering this house,

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:25.841
approaching Ji-yu,

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:28.427
and doing the TV interview?

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:29.720
Everything?

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:37.353
Never mind.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:41.190
Nothing has been confirmed,
so I won't jump to conclusions.

00:07:48.489 --> 00:07:49.740
Sign it.

00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.207
CONSENT FOR DNA TESTING

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.839
Hello?

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.592
Listen to me carefully.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.468
I know you're with Cha Su-yeon now.

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:16.225
You said you wanted
to catch your mother's killer.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:18.811
I'll help you with that. In return,

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:22.690
DNA test or whatever,
don't do what Su-yeon wants you to do.

00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:26.319
Is that Chairman Yang?

00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:28.696
Is he telling you not to do the test?

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.114
Why should I listen to you?

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.285
Because the murderer who killed your mom

00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:37.079
is Cha Su-yeon.

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:58.351
OUR KONGGUKSU IS
FRESHLY HOMEMADE EVERY DAY

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.239
We're closed.

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:14.575
The owner went home.

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:21.999
Darn it. Now I lost appetite.

00:09:28.214 --> 00:09:29.507
I said we're closed.

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:39.517
What are you doing?

00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:43.813
What the hell are you doing?

00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:49.360
What?

00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:50.695
I have nowhere to go.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:55.032
You're a nut.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.953
There's no one.

00:10:00.538 --> 00:10:02.957
There's no one I can open up to.

00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:07.628
There's no one.

00:10:35.322 --> 00:10:37.199
Tae-hun was just an excuse.

00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:41.954
Just like the election was an excuse.

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:46.917
Just like I divided everything
into what helps or hurts the election,

00:10:49.462 --> 00:10:50.713
I divided everything

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:56.010
into what's for Tae-hun and what's not.

00:10:57.052 --> 00:10:58.679
The election is over,

00:11:00.765 --> 00:11:02.558
and the special act's been passed,

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:05.227
but nothing has changed.

00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:09.899
If anything, things have gotten worse.

00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:14.904
Even though Sun-jeong is dead now,

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:19.909
my wife…

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.084
Whatever happens,

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.422
I will weigh everything,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.092
whether it's politically favorable or not.

00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:40.095
How nasty and low, right?

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:46.393
Just like the people
I've been criticizing.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.521
No, actually,

00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:53.108
I'm even nastier than them.

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:57.404
I promised myself over and over again

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.867
that I wouldn't be like them.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:12.253
Still, I lived my life.

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:17.007
No matter how nasty it was,

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.136
and no matter how low it got,

00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:25.140
I lived my life.

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:31.939
But Sun-jeong…

00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:36.110
She was just…

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:41.240
stuck in that photo.

00:12:42.908 --> 00:12:43.993
In that photo,

00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:49.331
which she wasn't even in…

00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:54.795
She was stuck in there.

00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:57.590
No.

00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:02.094
You're wrong.

00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:06.724
She had a daughter.

00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:09.643
Sun-jeong had a daughter.

00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:12.479
Her daughter was

00:13:13.689 --> 00:13:15.316
her life.

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:19.278
Sun-jeong…

00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:23.449
lived her life too.

00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:46.013
There it is.

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:50.494
HASEONG HIGH SCHOOL

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:57.501
-Are you staying late to study?
-No.

00:14:57.584 --> 00:14:59.586
Hey, Ji-yu is here.

00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.564
ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

00:15:18.647 --> 00:15:20.649
IS HE REALLY YOUR DAD?

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:21.817
AFFAIR

00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:58.395
What's up?

00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:00.856
Did the teacher send you to get me?

00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:03.901
No.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.740
Then why did you come?

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:13.827
I just wanted to see if you were okay.

00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:16.997
I've been saying "the worst"
all the time lately.

00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:21.001
I called my mom the worst,

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:23.337
and I called my dad the worst.

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:26.173
But

00:16:27.257 --> 00:16:28.759
you know who's really the worst?

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:30.344
The kids?

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:31.929
No.

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:33.388
Then who?

00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:35.224
Me.

00:16:37.142 --> 00:16:39.853
My mom isn't the one
who got the wrong idea first.

00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:42.564
It was me.

00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:47.569
The person who might be my dad's daughter…

00:16:49.905 --> 00:16:52.825
I thought
she was having an affair with my dad.

00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:58.789
My dad denied it,

00:16:59.957 --> 00:17:02.084
but I didn't believe him.

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:08.799
Aren't I the worst?

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.385
It was just a mistake.

00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:15.139
That's what other kids would say too.
That it's just a mistake.

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:17.182
So I deserve a punishment.

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.475
Is this your punishment?

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:19.643
Yes.

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:23.981
Just ditching class
and lying down like this.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.484
Doing nothing and zoning out.

00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:30.112
The scariest punishment in the world.

00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:32.948
Make today the last day you're punished.

00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:39.371
Did you know I hated your dad?

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:47.671
I felt like it was your dad's fault that
my mom's life was so hectic every day.

00:17:50.174 --> 00:17:51.466
I didn't know.

00:17:53.093 --> 00:17:55.429
You never told me that.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:59.683
Even when everyone was attacking me,
like today.

00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:03.478
It's ridiculous to hate you
just because I hate your dad.

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:05.439
You're a different person.

00:18:05.522 --> 00:18:07.524
But still.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:10.819
We're both children of our parents,

00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:12.821
but we're also just ourselves.

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:18.118
So we don't need to carry
our parents' burdens.

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:21.580
It may be your fault to be mistaken,

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:25.292
but other things
like the illegitimate child issue are not.

00:18:36.762 --> 00:18:37.930
Then what?

00:18:39.014 --> 00:18:40.807
Are you worried I might ask for more?

00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:10.295
Recognizing you

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:11.546
as family?

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.341
If I ask you to do that,

00:19:14.424 --> 00:19:15.759
will you?

00:19:18.887 --> 00:19:20.973
You think you can take me down like this?

00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:25.269
Nothing can take me down.

00:19:26.395 --> 00:19:27.604
Absolutely not.

00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:40.367
HASEONG POLICE STATION

00:19:47.374 --> 00:19:48.792
Cha Su-yeon speaking.

00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:52.587
HASEONG POLICE STATION

00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:03.056
CRIME-FREE SOCIETY
WITH HASEONG POLICE STATION

00:20:29.624 --> 00:20:30.959
Hey, hurry over.

00:20:31.543 --> 00:20:32.669
Come here, you punk.

00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:33.920
Who's that?

00:20:34.004 --> 00:20:36.006
Wow, she looks so charismatic.

00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:38.133
Wow, awesome.

00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:39.676
What are you looking at? Move!

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.345
Come on, you punks.

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.819
I thought everything about the necklace
was explained in the petition.

00:20:57.903 --> 00:21:00.072
Today, you're summoned for another case.

00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:04.409
You recently junked a car, right?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.453
A car that got into an accident.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:11.208
But luckily, there were still
investigation records of it.

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:21.927
On March 5,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.470
you caused a car accident.

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:25.972
The skid mark found at that scene

00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:28.058
matches the skid mark

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:32.687
found at the hit-and-run scene
by the seashore on February 26.

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:42.447
Not just by the naked eye,

00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:46.159
but also according to
the National Forensic Service's analysis.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:47.911
Of course,

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:50.122
there's a video of it too.

00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:06.596
February 26, around 5:00 p.m.,

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.848
this video was recorded

00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:10.517
by the dashcam of a courier vehicle
passing the scene.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.060
The victim was Eom Sun-jeong.

00:22:20.527 --> 00:22:23.280
You know I crave alcohol
after I work overtime…

00:22:29.202 --> 00:22:30.203
Ms. Cha.

00:22:30.287 --> 00:22:32.789
You and Eom Sun-jeong
knew each other, right?

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:42.215
Take care.

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:44.509
Bye!

00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:51.349
That's unusual of you to drink.

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:53.226
Are you okay?

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.272
Don't worry. I felt like drinking.

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:00.525
Put your seatbelt on.

00:23:09.534 --> 00:23:10.368
Wait.

00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:13.413
No way. I don't want you to catch a cold.

00:23:13.997 --> 00:23:14.873
There.

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:19.044
There you go.

00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:21.546
Ms. Cha.

00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:27.135
We thought
it was a simple hit-and-run case,

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:31.264
but after watching News Magazine,
we learned that you were related.

00:23:31.348 --> 00:23:33.934
Lee Hwa-jin, the girl
involved in the necklace case,

00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:36.186
turned out to be Eom Sun-jeong's daughter.

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:39.147
Which helped us confirm
that the car whose license plate

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.234
wasn't caught in the dashcam footage

00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:44.736
was your car, Ms. Cha.

00:23:45.403 --> 00:23:47.155
On February 26,

00:23:47.239 --> 00:23:48.740
around 5:00 p.m.,

00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:51.660
where were you?

00:23:58.541 --> 00:24:00.252
I'll call my lawyer.

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:17.644
What are you doing here?

00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:20.230
I'm here because you got in trouble.

00:24:20.313 --> 00:24:21.898
What's with the tofu?

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:23.233
So corny.

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:25.235
Just eat it.

00:24:25.902 --> 00:24:28.363
You didn't have one
when you were released before, right?

00:24:28.446 --> 00:24:30.323
That's why you came here again.

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:33.660
Did you just pull back? I said, eat it.

00:24:35.287 --> 00:24:37.247
Fine. I'll eat it.

00:24:45.213 --> 00:24:46.881
Is Hwa-jin still in the hospital?

00:24:48.466 --> 00:24:49.426
No.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.678
She's occupied with something.

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:53.847
Something? What something?

00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:57.267
You're not the only one
who caused trouble.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.644
Hwa-jin got into big trouble. You ask her.

00:24:59.728 --> 00:25:01.354
What happened?

00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:02.897
I don't know.

00:25:02.981 --> 00:25:04.774
I said, you ask her yourself.

00:25:04.858 --> 00:25:07.402
Aren't you worried about your only friend?

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:10.613
When she got into big trouble
after being discharged?

00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:12.115
Hey!

00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:17.871
How could I be worrying about her
when my only brother got arrested?

00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:22.292
Why are you crying?
You're embarrassing me.

00:25:23.668 --> 00:25:27.130
You could've ended up
in jail again, you know.

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:29.299
I told you to stay away from trouble!

00:25:29.382 --> 00:25:31.634
I told you to stay away from trouble!

00:25:31.718 --> 00:25:33.511
Geez, it hurts.

00:25:39.684 --> 00:25:41.394
Ew, gross! Get off of me!

00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:43.146
I'm sorry, okay?

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.608
Don't worry. I'll be better.

00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:48.151
Get off of me.

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:50.362
It hurts.

00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:54.949
Eat it.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:57.035
-I ate it.
-Eat the whole thing.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.790
CHA SU-YEON

00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:03.750
I'm serious. Eat the whole thing.

00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:08.755
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:16.346
EOM SUN-JEONG

00:26:20.392 --> 00:26:21.643
Was it

00:26:22.477 --> 00:26:24.396
really Ms. Cha's doing?

00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:27.273
The police are investigating her,

00:26:27.357 --> 00:26:28.817
so it'll be on the news soon.

00:26:30.235 --> 00:26:31.820
So,

00:26:31.903 --> 00:26:33.822
don't do the paternity test.

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:36.950
Doing that now will only help Cha Su-yeon.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.536
Why is that helping her?

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.332
If she's committed a crime,
she'll go to jail, right?

00:26:46.793 --> 00:26:48.420
You're so naive, Hwa-jin.

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:51.089
The president

00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:53.258
has the right to grant clemency.

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.178
Even if she gets arrested
for a hit-and-run accident,

00:26:57.262 --> 00:27:00.640
if Hyun Min-cheol wants to,
he can free her.

00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:02.100
And Hwa-jin,

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:04.727
you're the only person who can stop that.

00:27:05.353 --> 00:27:06.396
How, though?

00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:09.315
With your existence,

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:13.403
he wouldn't dare do it,
even if he's president.

00:27:14.404 --> 00:27:17.449
He abandoned your mom,
and his wife killed her.

00:27:17.532 --> 00:27:19.534
So how would he dare free her?

00:27:19.617 --> 00:27:20.910
I don't understand

00:27:21.953 --> 00:27:23.621
what you're saying.

00:27:24.831 --> 00:27:26.249
You don't need to.

00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.335
That's just how things work,

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:31.296
and what matters now is that

00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:33.923
you have the power
to make things work that way.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.137
And how would that benefit you?

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:42.682
Remember last time?

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:46.102
After you said you'd give me money
if I did as you said,

00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:49.022
you ordered that man to lock me up.

00:27:51.983 --> 00:27:52.859
Don't you remember?

00:27:55.778 --> 00:27:57.155
Come on.

00:27:58.323 --> 00:27:59.824
You can't put it that way.

00:28:01.326 --> 00:28:03.369
I didn't lock you up.

00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:06.998
I fed you, clothed you,
and put a roof over you.

00:28:07.874 --> 00:28:08.875
And what?

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:10.960
Benefit?

00:28:11.044 --> 00:28:12.795
I'm getting nothing out of this.

00:28:13.588 --> 00:28:17.675
This is all for your mother,
who died unjustly.

00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:25.558
Eom Min-jeong.

00:28:31.898 --> 00:28:33.399
I'm talking about your mother.

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:38.655
Your mother, who went to jail
after taking the fall for you

00:28:38.738 --> 00:28:40.615
and died only a week

00:28:40.698 --> 00:28:41.699
after her release.

00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:46.204
Mom.

00:29:09.602 --> 00:29:10.645
Remember.

00:29:12.063 --> 00:29:14.399
You were never here today.

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:38.298
Should I reveal why you abandoned
your name as Eom Min-jeong

00:29:39.424 --> 00:29:40.758
and lived as Lee Hwa-jin?

00:29:46.055 --> 00:29:48.266
What are you talking about?

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:49.559
Damn it!

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.193
Stop putting on a show.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.031
Now that all my cards are on the table,

00:30:03.823 --> 00:30:05.491
I can't just sit back and watch.

00:30:06.534 --> 00:30:10.330
I noticed you looked great on camera.

00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:13.207
Why don't you go on TV again?

00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:14.334
Go on TV

00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:16.711
and nail Cha Su-yeon's coffin

00:30:17.837 --> 00:30:19.672
with your own hands.

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:22.342
So she rots in jail forever.

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:30.892
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

00:30:33.937 --> 00:30:36.397
Hello. Please sit here.

00:30:41.694 --> 00:30:44.113
What happened on the show that day?

00:30:45.114 --> 00:30:46.240
The one with Hwa-jin.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.166
Would you like a drink?

00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:58.962
When it's so bright out?

00:30:59.045 --> 00:31:00.171
Even better.

00:31:01.464 --> 00:31:03.049
It's because I'm embarrassed.

00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.927
What do you mean?

00:31:06.928 --> 00:31:08.096
I need a drink.

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:11.516
Excuse me. Can I have a bottle of soju?

00:31:11.599 --> 00:31:12.517
Sure.

00:31:13.267 --> 00:31:15.478
Drinking in broad daylight. Interesting.

00:31:16.604 --> 00:31:18.189
Lawyer Kang asked me

00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:19.941
why I became a reporter.

00:31:21.567 --> 00:31:22.568
What did you say?

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.822
There was definitely a reason,

00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:27.532
but I couldn't remember.

00:31:28.658 --> 00:31:29.826
Thank you.

00:31:30.743 --> 00:31:32.203
Then that happened

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.247
on the live show.

00:31:36.457 --> 00:31:37.792
Remember my former boss?

00:31:38.584 --> 00:31:39.460
The Sewer.

00:31:41.087 --> 00:31:42.130
The Sewer?

00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:47.552
Because all dirty information went to him,

00:31:47.635 --> 00:31:50.096
he was called the Sewer. Gu Jeong-u.

00:31:50.847 --> 00:31:53.141
Oh, I remember.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:56.978
It was a perfect nickname for him.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.024
His first scoop was

00:32:01.107 --> 00:32:04.235
Cha Su-yeon being an illegitimate child
when she was seven.

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:07.905
Because of that news,

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.783
her mother killed herself.

00:32:12.285 --> 00:32:14.829
That was the only useful thing

00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:18.458
I learned from him.

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:23.671
That reporters can kill.

00:32:34.182 --> 00:32:35.850
That was when I realized

00:32:36.434 --> 00:32:38.394
why I became a reporter

00:32:38.895 --> 00:32:40.855
and why I couldn't answer him.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.444
I'm sorry.

00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:50.031
With the president-elect's divorce

00:32:50.114 --> 00:32:52.450
and the situations changing so rapidly,

00:32:52.992 --> 00:32:55.411
I was too harsh on you.

00:32:56.287 --> 00:32:58.623
They say you take after someone you hate.

00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:01.250
I've become like the Sewer myself.

00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:03.419
The dark and dirty sewer

00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:07.131
where all dirty stuff flows in and out,

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:10.635
using the ratings as an excuse.

00:33:16.766 --> 00:33:18.142
You don't have to apologize.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.978
I'm no different from you.

00:33:22.814 --> 00:33:25.650
I guess it's true
that you take after someone you hate.

00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:29.195
Because that happened to me too.

00:33:29.278 --> 00:33:30.613
Who do you mean?

00:33:30.696 --> 00:33:31.656
President-elect?

00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:35.868
No. I've become like Ms. Cha.

00:33:39.664 --> 00:33:42.250
"I won't become like her."

00:33:43.668 --> 00:33:46.462
"I could never do things her way."

00:33:47.672 --> 00:33:49.757
I used to think that.

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:52.343
Is that why you quit?

00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:02.061
I didn't believe it when I heard the news,
but I get it now.

00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:03.729
You really quit.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:05.648
How are you sure?

00:34:07.024 --> 00:34:10.820
You didn't ask what information I dug up.

00:34:11.863 --> 00:34:14.282
Not a question on what I found out
about Eom Sun-jeong

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.452
and how I'm going to report the news
and so on.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.458
I guess we won't see

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.752
each other again.

00:34:31.132 --> 00:34:32.925
We'll meet again soon enough.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.888
When we do,

00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:39.807
pretend you don't know me.

00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:46.856
TEAM LEADER CHEON

00:34:50.693 --> 00:34:52.236
Just leave me alone.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.488
Cha Su-yeon is at Haseong Police Station.

00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:57.158
She's being investigated
for Eom's hit-and-run.

00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:00.203
Cha Su-yeon and hit-and-run?

00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:02.914
Who tipped it off?

00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:05.416
That's not important right now.

00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:07.793
I confirmed Cha Su-yeon is
at the police station.

00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:11.172
Reporter Kim is on the site,
but that's not enough.

00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:14.508
You interviewed Hwa-jin
who brought up the hit-and-run accident.

00:35:14.592 --> 00:35:18.095
You should report the case yourself
to make it more interesting.

00:35:29.607 --> 00:35:31.400
-I got to go.
-Son Min-ju.

00:35:33.236 --> 00:35:34.487
My goodness.

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:37.949
Why suddenly call me by my name
being so friendly?

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.200
You heard the call.

00:35:39.283 --> 00:35:40.409
Is it because of that?

00:35:40.493 --> 00:35:42.286
What on earth is happening?

00:35:43.371 --> 00:35:44.288
Can I

00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:46.707
ask you a favor?

00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.003
HASEONG POLICE STATION

00:35:51.671 --> 00:35:54.215
Gosh, it's been hours.

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:56.676
Where were you at 5:00 p.m.
on February 26?

00:35:56.759 --> 00:35:57.843
Just answer that.

00:36:02.473 --> 00:36:03.766
This is so frustrating.

00:36:04.725 --> 00:36:07.186
Detective, will you give us
some time alone?

00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:12.191
I'll talk it out with my client.

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:18.531
You better.

00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:40.511
Your schedule is open
to the public anyway.

00:36:40.594 --> 00:36:42.430
If you don't cooperate with the police,

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:45.391
it will put you at a disadvantage.

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:47.435
You're here as a witness now,

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:48.811
but if you keep this up,

00:36:50.313 --> 00:36:52.023
you could become the suspect.

00:36:53.024 --> 00:36:54.442
Cooperate with the police.

00:36:58.237 --> 00:36:59.322
Is the camera

00:36:59.864 --> 00:37:01.115
turned off?

00:37:01.198 --> 00:37:02.616
What?

00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:04.618
Yes.

00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:07.496
And we're not being voice recorded?

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.084
We're not. Why do you suddenly ask--

00:37:12.168 --> 00:37:14.295
You deceived me, who is your client,

00:37:15.504 --> 00:37:17.548
and even stole from me.

00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:23.054
I will let it go,

00:37:23.596 --> 00:37:24.597
but in return,

00:37:28.392 --> 00:37:29.685
I need you

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.480
to do something for me.

00:37:34.398 --> 00:37:38.944
WORKING WITH LABORERS
KWON HAK-SEON LAW OFFICE

00:37:39.028 --> 00:37:40.988
WHY DO INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS
REPEAT THEMSELVES?

00:37:41.655 --> 00:37:43.908
AUTHOR, KWON HAK-SEON

00:37:47.495 --> 00:37:51.665
I'm sorry this is all I have to offer
when you came all the way here.

00:37:57.838 --> 00:37:59.090
Lawyer Kwon.

00:37:59.173 --> 00:38:01.217
Please chair the Committee.

00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:10.226
I remember the day we first met.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.937
You were going to sue

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:16.982
Haseong Petrochemical
for worker's compensation.

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:22.113
You said it was a hopeless fight.

00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:24.323
That I could never win it.

00:38:24.407 --> 00:38:27.451
I also said
it wasn't your battle to fight.

00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:29.745
That you may be like brothers,

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:32.998
but it wasn't a battle you could fight
for someone else.

00:38:34.583 --> 00:38:36.502
It wasn't for Tae-hun.

00:38:37.253 --> 00:38:38.462
It was for me.

00:38:39.422 --> 00:38:42.675
Turning a blind eye
and lying that it was his fault

00:38:44.468 --> 00:38:47.179
and not the company's,
just like my coworkers did.

00:38:49.014 --> 00:38:50.599
I couldn't bear to see myself

00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:54.145
move on with my life
like nothing happened.

00:38:55.396 --> 00:38:56.814
You

00:38:56.897 --> 00:38:58.399
haven't changed at all.

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:09.535
This place hasn't changed either.

00:39:12.621 --> 00:39:14.123
I wasn't going to come to you,

00:39:15.082 --> 00:39:17.626
but you're the only one I can trust.

00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:20.921
You'll face strong opposition.

00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:25.342
I almost lost my lawyer's license
because I blew the whistle on H Group.

00:39:25.426 --> 00:39:26.927
If I chair the Special Committee,

00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:29.889
people will question its impartiality.

00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.683
I don't want you to become the judge.

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:36.145
I want you to fight against those

00:39:36.937 --> 00:39:38.355
who try to hide the truth.

00:39:38.939 --> 00:39:39.982
A sword doesn't

00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:42.401
discriminate who it hurts.

00:39:48.699 --> 00:39:51.285
I went through the special act.

00:39:53.412 --> 00:39:56.373
There's a clause on the investigation
of newly identified cases.

00:39:57.249 --> 00:40:02.254
If any evidence were to emerge
that someone was involved in the fire,

00:40:02.922 --> 00:40:06.592
the subjects of the investigation
could be expanded.

00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:10.804
And your wife

00:40:10.888 --> 00:40:12.640
is no exception.

00:40:13.224 --> 00:40:14.308
Do you still

00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:16.936
want me to take on the position?

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.117
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the hit-and-run.

00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:34.787
I found out
as I was checking for an update

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.081
on the hit-and-run investigation
as you ordered.

00:40:37.164 --> 00:40:39.333
She's called in as a witness.

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:40.501
Let's go to the station.

00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:45.422
Reporters have already flocked over there.

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:47.800
So?

00:40:47.883 --> 00:40:50.553
Even if you go now,
there's nothing you can do.

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:53.472
Rather, you'll draw more attention
and make it worse.

00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:55.266
My wife is at the police station now.

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:57.601
Did you forget
who the victim of the case is?

00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:59.144
It's Eom Sun-jeong.

00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:01.438
The public opinion is
as bad as it can get,

00:41:01.522 --> 00:41:05.234
and Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the case that killed Hwa-jin's mom.

00:41:05.317 --> 00:41:07.570
Witness or not, it doesn't matter.

00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:08.737
The fact is

00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:10.864
that I'm her husband.

00:41:10.948 --> 00:41:11.949
And

00:41:13.242 --> 00:41:15.619
that I can't leave her there alone.

00:41:16.328 --> 00:41:17.329
President-elect.

00:41:17.913 --> 00:41:19.206
Wait, President-elect.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.375
Cha Su-yeon, the wife of President-elect,

00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:24.420
is being investigated for
the Eom Sun-jeong hit-and-run case.

00:41:24.503 --> 00:41:26.880
It's only been two days since Lee Hwa-jin,

00:41:26.964 --> 00:41:30.634
who claims to be President-elect's
illegitimate child, urged the police

00:41:30.718 --> 00:41:33.053
to apprehend the hit-and-run offender.

00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:36.557
A hit-and-run allegation
following an illegitimate child scandal.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.601
People are demanding explanations

00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:41.145
for the allegations
surrounding President-elect.

00:41:46.734 --> 00:41:47.776
You saw the news?

00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:52.072
This is what makes journalism rewarding.

00:41:52.656 --> 00:41:55.242
Since your interview aired,

00:41:55.326 --> 00:41:57.369
we've been getting tons of tip-offs.

00:41:57.453 --> 00:42:00.539
The once-slow investigation
has gained momentum now.

00:42:00.623 --> 00:42:04.793
What's more, it's none other than Ms. Cha
in the police station.

00:42:05.377 --> 00:42:06.754
So I want to suggest

00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:09.923
a follow-up interview with you.

00:42:11.425 --> 00:42:12.885
I have nothing left to say.

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:16.680
Come on, I'm sure you have more to say.

00:42:16.764 --> 00:42:19.683
The online forum is being bombarded
by curious viewers.

00:42:20.517 --> 00:42:22.311
I already said in the interview

00:42:22.394 --> 00:42:25.356
that I came on the show
to catch the hit-and-run offender.

00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:27.608
I don't care as long as
they catch the offender.

00:42:29.401 --> 00:42:32.488
If Ms. Cha is the culprit,
that's not the end.

00:42:33.364 --> 00:42:34.573
It could be the beginning.

00:42:39.203 --> 00:42:40.871
The beginning? What do you mean?

00:42:41.538 --> 00:42:43.791
President-elect could get involved too.

00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:47.878
Do you think he really didn't know
that his wife

00:42:48.962 --> 00:42:50.047
killed your mother?

00:42:54.885 --> 00:42:56.512
He might've turned a blind eye…

00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:02.184
or been her accomplice.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.107
That's impossible.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.151
Ms. Eom passed away
a week before the election.

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:15.280
If your existence became known,
it would've been critical for him.

00:43:15.364 --> 00:43:18.117
To stop Eom Sun-jeong from talking,

00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:21.245
the couple would've done anything.

00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:24.623
So if you do another interview,

00:43:24.707 --> 00:43:27.000
I'm sure we'll get more tip-offs.

00:43:27.084 --> 00:43:29.044
A secret tends to reveal itself

00:43:30.254 --> 00:43:32.881
the more you try to hide it.

00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:50.065
My gosh.

00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.734
So there is a secret.

00:43:53.277 --> 00:43:57.030
How should I present this information
to make it look more enticing?

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.202
I checked the investigation records
of Eom Min-jeong.

00:44:02.286 --> 00:44:05.205
She died from a road accident,
and Hwa-jin was with her.

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:07.958
She pretended to be
the dead daughter on TV?

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:11.587
She told a lie
that would be exposed right away.

00:44:13.672 --> 00:44:15.549
Keep it, but don't tell Reporter Son.

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:18.719
No, do not tell anyone else that

00:44:18.802 --> 00:44:20.554
Hwa-jin is actually Eom Min-jeong.

00:44:20.637 --> 00:44:22.431
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

00:44:22.514 --> 00:44:23.474
You can go back.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.608
Hello, Chairman.
This is Cheon U-hyeok of MBS.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.363
I got some special intel on Lee Hwa-jin,
so I called you.

00:44:39.114 --> 00:44:41.992
Gosh, no.
Think of it as my thank-you gift.

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:44.912
You tipped off
Ms. Cha's hit-and-run to me,

00:44:44.995 --> 00:44:48.040
and I can't just take it
without paying you back.

00:44:55.088 --> 00:44:57.007
CHAIRMAN YANG

00:45:00.761 --> 00:45:01.845
Hello, Chairman.

00:45:02.638 --> 00:45:03.847
Well…

00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:07.351
When should I schedule
Lee Hwa-jin's interview?

00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:10.687
Well, you should strike
when the iron is hot.

00:45:11.438 --> 00:45:13.148
This week works best.

00:45:14.983 --> 00:45:16.151
Don't worry.

00:45:16.777 --> 00:45:21.990
I'll skillfully coax Lee Hwa-jin into
saying things that'll put President-elect

00:45:23.158 --> 00:45:24.785
and his wife in a tight spot.

00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:26.662
In return,

00:45:27.412 --> 00:45:29.831
please sponsor the show
that'll launch soon

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:35.045
and back me all the way, okay?

00:46:18.463 --> 00:46:20.507
Did you use the shampoo I gave you?

00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:21.508
Yes.

00:46:23.844 --> 00:46:24.845
Not again.

00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:28.849
We have a separate foot towel.

00:46:28.932 --> 00:46:30.392
I washed very thoroughly.

00:46:30.475 --> 00:46:32.644
Still, wipe your feet with a foot towel.

00:46:32.728 --> 00:46:33.770
Fine.

00:46:39.026 --> 00:46:40.611
Stop fooling around.

00:46:40.694 --> 00:46:42.362
You still act like a baby.

00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:43.822
Because you nag me.

00:46:45.115 --> 00:46:47.326
Come here. I'll dry your hair.

00:46:58.837 --> 00:47:01.173
Using my shampoo makes your hair soft

00:47:01.256 --> 00:47:03.884
without using hair conditioner.
It's nice, right?

00:47:03.967 --> 00:47:05.552
Yes, it's convenient.

00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:09.556
It prevents hair loss too,
so make sure you use this shampoo.

00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:13.268
Do you know where the spare is
if it runs out?

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:15.312
You always put it in the cabinet.

00:47:15.395 --> 00:47:16.938
You remember.

00:47:17.022 --> 00:47:18.190
Of course.

00:47:20.442 --> 00:47:22.277
It's done. Turn around.

00:47:25.822 --> 00:47:29.117
You look so much more handsome
from just drying your hair.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.496
It adds volume to your hair too.

00:47:34.498 --> 00:47:35.540
Are you done?

00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:41.546
Since I dried your hair,
let's fold the laundry together.

00:47:47.386 --> 00:47:51.848
The washing machine does the laundry,
but you need to hang the clothes yourself.

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:54.935
Shake them out before you hang them up
so they don't wrinkle.

00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:57.062
Like this.

00:47:57.145 --> 00:47:58.855
Snap your wrists.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.275
-Like this?
-Not bad.

00:48:02.359 --> 00:48:04.152
I know that much.

00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:05.821
I'm a laundry expert.

00:48:05.904 --> 00:48:08.615
I did all the washing and hanging
when you were busy.

00:48:09.449 --> 00:48:11.576
You must continue to do so.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.455
Do the laundry, clean the house,
and wash the dishes.

00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:20.544
You can call yourself an adult
only when you can do all those yourself.

00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:22.671
Do you have more to nag?

00:48:22.754 --> 00:48:24.423
I'm feeling a bit sleepy.

00:48:26.508 --> 00:48:29.302
The sleeves have become
too short for you already.

00:48:30.387 --> 00:48:32.931
You grow so fast, Gang-myeong.

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:34.850
Your school uniforms?

00:48:34.933 --> 00:48:36.810
We bought them just recently.

00:48:38.353 --> 00:48:40.522
I'm not worried about winter uniforms,

00:48:40.605 --> 00:48:43.316
but your summer uniforms
might be too small by then.

00:48:44.317 --> 00:48:46.945
Should we have bought one size bigger?

00:48:47.028 --> 00:48:49.156
I said we should buy
the summer ones later,

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:51.116
but you insisted on buying them together.

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:55.245
I wanted to see you in a summer uniform.

00:48:55.912 --> 00:48:58.582
I thought that was the only day
I could see you in it.

00:48:59.666 --> 00:49:01.126
Why is that the only day?

00:49:04.045 --> 00:49:05.088
Are you going somewhere?

00:49:06.631 --> 00:49:08.550
It was my dream.

00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:10.969
You know,

00:49:11.511 --> 00:49:14.598
they all wear summer school uniforms
in movies about first love.

00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:18.685
You're the perfect first love material.

00:49:19.394 --> 00:49:21.688
Are you done nagging? I'm going to bed.

00:49:27.152 --> 00:49:28.111
An Gang-myeong.

00:49:39.664 --> 00:49:40.707
I'm really going to bed.

00:49:41.917 --> 00:49:43.919
Good night, my dear son.

00:51:32.652 --> 00:51:34.487
Let's see how much you've grown.

00:51:35.071 --> 00:51:37.115
-One span.
-Dad, it's ticklish.

00:51:37.198 --> 00:51:38.491
Two spans.

00:51:38.575 --> 00:51:40.577
-Stop.
-Three spans.

00:51:41.328 --> 00:51:42.537
Four spans?

00:51:43.163 --> 00:51:45.540
Five, six spans?

00:51:46.166 --> 00:51:47.167
What?

00:51:47.709 --> 00:51:49.336
An Gang-myeong, this is cheating.

00:51:50.045 --> 00:51:51.630
I told you not to grow so fast.

00:51:52.213 --> 00:51:54.007
Didn't I? This is cheating.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.051
-Why are you growing so fast?
-Dad.

00:51:56.134 --> 00:51:58.053
-Who said you could?
-Stop. It's ticklish.

00:51:58.136 --> 00:51:59.971
-Who said you could?
-It's ticklish.

00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:02.140
My goodness.

00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:05.143
Don't grow up so fast.

00:52:07.228 --> 00:52:09.689
Gosh, my dear son.

00:52:56.945 --> 00:52:59.698
It's been hours, damn it.

00:53:00.448 --> 00:53:02.450
We might really stay up all night.

00:53:03.159 --> 00:53:04.786
She's one tenacious woman.

00:53:11.126 --> 00:53:12.252
Lawyer Song.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.005
What brings you here?

00:53:15.088 --> 00:53:16.589
Could I have a word with you?

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.550
I have something to discuss.

00:53:20.719 --> 00:53:22.929
Get out of the way!

00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:24.973
Please, get out of the way.

00:53:25.056 --> 00:53:26.224
Please, Lawyer Kang.

00:53:26.307 --> 00:53:28.977
Please, let me out.

00:53:31.354 --> 00:53:33.523
Listen, it was me.

00:53:33.606 --> 00:53:35.692
I hit Eom Sun-jeong with a car.

00:53:35.775 --> 00:53:37.777
So please let me go.

00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.404
Ms. Sung.

00:53:39.487 --> 00:53:42.032
Ms. Cha repeatedly told me

00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:45.702
that you'd lie and say you did it
when you found out where she was.

00:53:45.785 --> 00:53:47.620
I'm not lying.

00:53:47.704 --> 00:53:49.914
How many times must I say this?

00:53:49.998 --> 00:53:52.042
It was me who hit her with a car.

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.251
I have to go.

00:53:53.334 --> 00:53:54.961
Ms. Cha shouldn't be

00:53:55.045 --> 00:53:58.173
at a horrid place like the police station
for even a minute.

00:53:58.256 --> 00:53:59.382
Ms. Sung!

00:53:59.466 --> 00:54:02.135
Ms. Sung. Ms. Cha told me

00:54:03.803 --> 00:54:06.389
to make sure
you didn't go to the police station.

00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:10.101
How could I not go?

00:54:10.185 --> 00:54:11.811
Because of my old self,

00:54:11.895 --> 00:54:15.065
Ms. Cha is going through tough times
in the police station.

00:54:15.148 --> 00:54:16.858
How could I not go?

00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:20.779
I'm the one that deserves to be punished.
I'm the sinner.

00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:22.781
No.

00:54:23.907 --> 00:54:26.576
What should I do?

00:54:26.659 --> 00:54:27.869
Oh, no.

00:54:27.952 --> 00:54:29.996
What do I do?

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.957
I need you to do something for me.

00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:35.543
When Ms. Sung finds out that I'm here,

00:54:35.627 --> 00:54:37.879
she'll definitely want to come over.

00:54:37.962 --> 00:54:39.089
So,

00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:41.508
stop her from coming here.

00:54:50.642 --> 00:54:52.352
It was Ms. Sung

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.147
who drove that day, right? It wasn't you.

00:54:57.357 --> 00:54:59.109
Is that important?

00:54:59.192 --> 00:55:01.861
You're a lawyer
who defends even the guilty, no?

00:55:04.781 --> 00:55:08.201
Is that why you've kept your mouth shut
until now?

00:55:09.369 --> 00:55:10.495
To take the rap

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:12.664
for Ms. Sung?

00:55:12.747 --> 00:55:15.792
You're a lawyer, not a judge.

00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:19.712
So,

00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:23.341
Ms. Sung is innocent. Do you understand?

00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:26.511
Yes, I get what you mean.

00:55:28.096 --> 00:55:30.265
But there's a problem.

00:55:30.348 --> 00:55:32.767
I am currently your lawyer.

00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.853
If I'm to defend Ms. Sung,

00:55:34.936 --> 00:55:38.523
both you and she need
to sign the Conflict of Interest Waiver.

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:39.607
No.

00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:40.984
There's no need.

00:55:42.026 --> 00:55:44.779
Lawyer Kang, I am dismissing you.

00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:48.491
From now on,
you're no longer my legal representative.

00:55:49.075 --> 00:55:51.953
I don't care what happens to me.
Just focus on Ms. Sung.

00:55:52.036 --> 00:55:53.288
Then it's good, right?

00:55:58.042 --> 00:55:59.127
Ms. Sung.

00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:03.006
You said Ms. Cha and I must be like family

00:56:03.673 --> 00:56:06.176
since we lived together for a long time.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.432
I didn't give birth to her myself,

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.394
but she's more precious
than a daughter to me.

00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:22.984
She's the only person I could rely on
for the past 40 years.

00:56:31.409 --> 00:56:33.828
And she is now at the police station.

00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:36.831
So let me see her at least.

00:56:36.915 --> 00:56:38.791
I just want to see her.

00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:40.418
I mean,

00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:42.670
if I'm innocent,

00:56:42.754 --> 00:56:46.591
you can defend me and prove my innocence.

00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:50.720
Please. Please let me go see her.

00:56:50.803 --> 00:56:53.681
Please, I beg you.

00:57:12.575 --> 00:57:14.118
You promised.

00:57:14.202 --> 00:57:16.538
We'll just check how she's doing
and come back.

00:57:16.621 --> 00:57:18.540
I said I promised.

00:57:18.623 --> 00:57:22.585
You can't say you're
the hit-and-run driver like earlier.

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:25.755
You'll get me out anyway.

00:57:27.632 --> 00:57:30.468
This isn't the matter of getting you out.

00:57:31.052 --> 00:57:32.971
Everyone denies their crimes.

00:57:33.054 --> 00:57:34.305
You're the opposite--

00:57:34.389 --> 00:57:36.307
How am I not guilty?

00:57:37.267 --> 00:57:41.854
I made Ms. Cha suffer for half a day
in that horrendous place.

00:57:43.147 --> 00:57:45.608
I hope she hasn't caught a cold
in that cold place.

00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:50.405
If she catches a cold around this time,
she'll take long to recover.

00:57:54.867 --> 00:57:56.119
My goodness.

00:57:56.202 --> 00:57:57.954
How worn out will she become?

00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:01.416
She only managed to recover recently.

00:58:14.512 --> 00:58:17.599
LIHO EXPRESS

00:59:10.026 --> 00:59:12.528
I took care of them as you ordered.

00:59:12.612 --> 00:59:14.447
Are you sure it worked this time?

00:59:15.031 --> 00:59:17.116
Yes, I'm sure, sir.

00:59:33.174 --> 00:59:34.342
I'll do it.

00:59:34.425 --> 00:59:35.802
The paternity test.

00:59:38.304 --> 00:59:39.639
Ms. Cha is demanding

00:59:39.722 --> 00:59:41.683
a paternity test from Lee Hwa-jin.

00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:45.937
If Ms. Sung goes to the police station,
Ms. Cha will be released.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.731
She'll do anything for Ms. Cha.

01:00:19.679 --> 01:00:23.099
100,000,000 KRW DEPOSITED

01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:32.817
-He's here!
-He's here!

01:00:34.986 --> 01:00:37.363
President-elect,
share your thoughts with us.

01:00:37.447 --> 01:00:38.322
To your position.

01:00:38.406 --> 01:00:39.574
Get in your position.

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.079
-Don't push.
-Wait.

01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.123
-Say something.
-Move aside.

01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:50.168
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for Eom's hit-and-run.

01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:51.836
How do you feel about it?

01:00:52.336 --> 01:00:53.379
She's just a witness.

01:00:53.463 --> 01:00:56.507
Were you aware of her involvement
in Eom Sun-jeong's death?

01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:58.301
Some suggest it was planned murder

01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:00.762
to silence her
about the illegitimate daughter.

01:01:01.763 --> 01:01:04.140
I already said
she was brought in as a witness.

01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:07.143
Some even suggest
that you instigated the murder of Eom.

01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:10.730
Refrain from groundless assumptions
and reports.

01:01:10.813 --> 01:01:13.524
"She's just a witness,
it's a groundless assumption."

01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:17.236
Don't you think you're suggesting
guidelines on the investigation

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.530
just by saying that
as the president-elect?

01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.617
The cops working on the case
could feel pressured

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.953
just from your presence here,
where Ms. Cha is being investigated.

01:01:26.037 --> 01:01:28.039
I'm not trying to pressure them

01:01:28.873 --> 01:01:31.167
or suggest guidelines
on the investigation.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.670
I just want to stay
as close as possible to my wife.

01:01:35.713 --> 01:01:38.841
If that in itself is wrong,
it can't be helped.

01:01:38.925 --> 01:01:40.051
I will have to

01:01:40.885 --> 01:01:41.886
commit the wrong.

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:44.722
Are you saying
you'll blatantly ignore the people?

01:01:44.806 --> 01:01:48.434
The people are raising suspicions
and are outraged.

01:01:48.518 --> 01:01:51.521
The allegations on an illegitimate child
and a hit-and-run.

01:01:51.604 --> 01:01:53.773
The people are
demanding your resignation.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.070
That anger.

01:01:59.987 --> 01:02:01.197
That fury.

01:02:02.698 --> 01:02:04.325
I'll accept wholly.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.245
But I won't turn away

01:02:08.204 --> 01:02:10.248
from my wife out of fear for them.

01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:11.332
If

01:02:11.415 --> 01:02:14.794
she is in any way involved
in the hit-and-run case,

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.547
do you intend to step down?

01:02:18.506 --> 01:02:20.508
Will you be responsible for your claim

01:02:20.591 --> 01:02:23.052
and put your presidency on the line?

01:02:25.388 --> 01:02:28.891
President-elect has nothing to do
with the hit-and-run.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.900
It's currently under investigation.
How can you be sure?

01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.864
Because I am

01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:45.157
the culprit.

01:02:50.872 --> 01:02:52.832
The person who killed Eom Sun-jeong…

01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:56.794
is me.

01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:52.475
Su-yeon.

01:03:53.059 --> 01:03:55.895
Tell me if you're involved
with Chairman Yang in any way.

01:03:56.395 --> 01:03:58.022
This is the last chance.

01:03:58.105 --> 01:03:59.690
If you mess around again,

01:03:59.774 --> 01:04:01.567
then I'll reveal this.

01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:06.030
The person standing on the receiving end
of your special act isn't Yang Hoon.

01:04:06.113 --> 01:04:07.823
It's Su-yeon.

01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:09.951
If the investigation

01:04:10.034 --> 01:04:12.620
reveals that I or my wife
were involved in the fire,

01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:14.330
-Honey!
-I will step down

01:04:14.413 --> 01:04:16.332
from my president-elect position

01:04:16.415 --> 01:04:18.000
immediately.

01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:21.170
