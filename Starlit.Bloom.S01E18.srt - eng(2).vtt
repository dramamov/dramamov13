I knew you'd be feeding seagulls here.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.880
Why didn't you answer my calls?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.000
I knew Lin Xiang would try
to bid on Xinghan's item.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.910
One million for a candy.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.750
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.520
Just because I said one wrong thing,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
you're going to be mad at me forever?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.390
Don't be mad.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.110
Let's make peace.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.990
Okay?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.355
So you did that during the charity gala
on purpose,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.360
and this is how you apologize?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.270

You're happy now?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.520
Do you know how long I prepared

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.040
for this event?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.670
Do you know how hard I worked

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.080
to keep those

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.920

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.270
And now you pull a stunt like that
in front of the media.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.710
How will they ever trust charity?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.040
How will they trust me again?

00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:02.040

I'm not a kid.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.990
