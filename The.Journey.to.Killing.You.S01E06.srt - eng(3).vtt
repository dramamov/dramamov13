00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
(Episode 6)

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.770
I keep having...

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.470
the same dream.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.120
A dream where I'm flying through the sky.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.510
In that pure white,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.890
empty sky.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm just flying aimlessly.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.620
Soon, I get exhausted.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.580
In the end,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.800
I'm going nowhere.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
Stop it.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.740
Stop it.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
Hey.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.400
You really went overboard.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.730
Did I tell you to beat him half to death?

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.350
Dad's furious.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.380
But whatever.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.120
I already smoothed things over for you, so don't worry.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.310
Hey.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.520
Be ready. You come when I call.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.320
Starting today, you're my kid.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.250
Kids are supposed to listen to their parents, right?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.690
Take it.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.580
I understand.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.530
You hate Kataoka, don't you?

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.580
He might as well have killed your friend.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.090
Odajima.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.530
Go kill Kataoka.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.820
The doctor is here to see you.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.440
He's out of the woods.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.420
He's a real fighter.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.700
It'll still take some time for him to recover,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.600
but we'll keep a close eye on him.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.250
I'll be going now.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.970
Kataoka-san.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.050
Seven years ago,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.010
Asahi died for you.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.720
Killing you...

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.510
became my only reason for living.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
But...

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.740
I also...

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.260
did the same thing Asahi did.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080
And then...

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.830
you saved me too.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Asahi.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.110
I...

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.470
have to go now.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500
"The Journey to Kill You"

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.750
Good work, Fourth Generation.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.230
I'm not officially the Fourth Generation yet.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600
Odajima.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.030
It's alright, Kumakura.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.740
Odajima.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.000
What? Starting to miss your old man?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.290
Where'd you run off to without a word?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.410
What is the meaning of this?

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.480
Here's 200 million.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.310
I want out of the organization.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.220
It's all yours.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.010
You've got some nerve.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.890
You think this chump change is enough to let you walk away clean?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
Odajima.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.760
Go kill Kataoka.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.580
This is a recording of you ordering a hit.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.710
Just as you're trying to consolidate your power,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.710
you wouldn't want to lose the loyalty
of the younger members, would you?

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.090
I can't believe you'd stoop to this...

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.550
Go wherever you want.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.330
And don't ever come back.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.360
Next time I see you, I'll kill you.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.860
So you don't even trust your own family anymore.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
You either.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.100
Asahi.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.250
I'm sorry.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.080
I couldn't keep our promise.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.910
Oh.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.240
Over there.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.130
I saw a bunch of tough-looking guys.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.860
I was wondering what was going on...

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440
You...

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.740
I never knew you could make a face like that.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.730
What do you think?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.910
My powers of recovery.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.500
I figured I could probably walk on my own,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.010
so I went for a little walk, and I'm totally fine.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.550
The doctor said...

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.950
- you still need to rest.
- Honestly...

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.390
Where did you think I'd run off to?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.500
There's no way I'd just run off

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.500
and leave my beloved wife behind.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.010
What is it?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.840
Feeling bold, are we?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.330
Since you're all better now,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.070
this shouldn't be too much for you, right?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800
Of course. It's a piece of cake.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.300
I've been holding back for a long time, too.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.340
I won't go easy on you.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.430
You're a really interesting guy.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.280
Is this revenge for your friend?

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.720
I'm...

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.400
someone who shouldn't have been...

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.580
born.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.780
Forgive your sister...

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.160
Please forgive your mother.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.720
Of course,

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.020
I had no reason to live.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360
But...

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.560
then I met Asahi.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.060
I'll be your family.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.670
But then Asahi died...

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.270
I convinced myself it was all your fault.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.180
From that day on,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.150
for seven years,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.990
killing...

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.720
you...

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.010
became my reason for living.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.570
Odajima.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.600
Over here.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.020
I told you, didn't I?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.530
Don't miss.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.520
Someone like me...

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.810
You...

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.890
Hey, Odajima.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.220
We're free.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.090
Hey, Odajima.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.540
Here's your Tropical Mango Special,
super-sized!

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.390
Awesome!

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.110
For real, for real.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.570
You don't seem like you're from Tokyo, old man.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.390
Old man?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.270
Huh? 'Cause you totally look like one.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.540
I totally look like one?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.750
Bro, bro.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.920
My name's...

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.280
Jima-chan.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.770
- Jima-chan?
- Let's take a picture!

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.830
Okay...

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:28.850
Let's take it together.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.210
Come on, get in here.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800
Ready?

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.050
Say cheese!

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.980
- See ya! That was fun!
- Thanks for coming.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.860
Bye-bye, old man.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440
You know,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.750
how come you're the only one getting all the attention?

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.410
You think so?

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.450
That Hawaiian shirt really doesn't suit you.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.990
It doesn't?

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.010
It doesn't?

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.070
It suits you well,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.110
Fourth Generation.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.030
I,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.000
Kirii Keito,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.870
succeeding my father,

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.030
do hereby,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.700
as the Fourth Generation leader of the Kirii Group,

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.060
humbly accept this appointment.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.010
Does it really look that bad on me?

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.550
It's a total mismatch.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.450
By the way,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.070
that old guy really is the president.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.030
Is that old guy our new boss?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.070
Man, you're so good at playing innocent.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.210
Sorry.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.610
Boss!

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.960
Oh, there you are, Eiji.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:21.880
Yes.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.740
Boss, that's a cool Hawaiian shirt.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.660
Right?

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.380
Hello.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.540
Oh.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.250
Uh...

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.890
Hm?

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.610
Sis!

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.750
I knew it, I can't!
No, no, no, no!

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.750
Hey.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.000
See you later, boss.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.020
I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.340
He's a cute kid, isn't he?

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.090
Right?

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.010
Sis.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.490
It's Odajima.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.130
Oh, is it Kataoka now?

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.470
Kataoka Ren.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.060
Has a nice ring to it.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.020
I keep having...

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.130
the same dream.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.400
In a pure white sky,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.750
birds are dancing.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.240
For some reason, I'm flying too.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.050
But I have no destination.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.050
I get exhausted and end up going nowhere.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.840
I've always had that dream.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.180
Well, look who's here.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.710
Yes.
