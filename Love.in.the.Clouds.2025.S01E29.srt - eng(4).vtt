00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.210
Congratulations on soon obtaining the Golden Millet Dream

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.900
and ruling the Six Realms, Your Majesty.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.850
Save the flattery.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.490
I called you here because I have

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.850
an important task for you.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.660
You have been

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.740
obsessively searching

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.900
for your missing brother, Ming Xian.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.460
Do you know where he is now?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.930
Does Your Majesty know where he is?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.380
It's no wonder you couldn't find him.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.460
Who would have imagined

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.500
that Ming Xian, Yaoguang Mountain's Warrior God, the winner seven years running,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.730
would actually be a fairy?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.380
She fled into enemy territory, Jixing Abyss,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.570
and even degraded herself

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.500
by marrying Ji Bozai.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.170
Ming Xian

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.450
is the little fairy beside Ji Bozai?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.940
Ming Xian went to Zhangwei Mountain,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.290
broke through the Zhulong Barrier,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.410
and took "Bo's Medical Classics."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.980
So, the blood flowing through her

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.820
must be from the Bo clan.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.540
How can that be?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.060
I didn't summon you here

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.220
to have you foolishly ask how that is possible.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.260
I have managed to manipulate the outcome of the drawing

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.850
so that the tea gathering will be held at Yaoguang Mountain.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.170
That is your territory. You know what to do.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.380
Ming Xian will attend the tea gathering

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.850
together with Ji Bozai.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.690
You will investigate her background,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.220
capture her alive,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.890
and bring her to me.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.380
Understood.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.890
You know how to use the Soul-seizing Technique, right?

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.450
I will not fail you, Your Majesty.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.500
So Father has suspected Ming Xian's background all along.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.100
Chao Yuan, do you wish to protect her?

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.370
Then grow stronger.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.930
Make yourself the only one by Ming Yi's side.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.050
That way, you can protect her,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.100
possess her,

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.850
and make her yours.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.810
Let me teach you how to truly be powerful.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.220
Your Highness.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.370
Or should I call you Chief Situ?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.220
To what do I owe the honor

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.900
of your summons?

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.250
Just call me Your Highness.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.290
I can bear the title.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.850
Lord Chengyun,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.050
you were the one who forcefully broke the array at Jixing Abyss

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.220
and tried to enter my Judgment Hall,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.930
weren't you?

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.660
You've been chasing after Ming Xian relentlessly,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.660
and even now, you still won't give up.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.850
Your Highness,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.050
what is it you really want from me?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.340
You were present when my father and I

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.660
spoke that day.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.100
You must have heard everything.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.140
Now, in all Six Realms,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.490
I am the only one who knows the recipe for the Golden Millet Dream.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.660
To make it,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.140
I first

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.490
need more vagrants.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.810
If you can lend me a hand in this,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.100
then once I've refined the Golden Millet Dream,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.700
I could consider sharing more of both the Golden Millet Dream

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.900
and the Heavenly Grief

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.780
with you.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.780
Your Highness,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.660
sounds like you have big ambitions.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.980
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.730
You want to become the ruler of Yaoguang Mountain,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.810
and I

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.540
want the throne of Zhushui.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.100
When the time comes,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.900
we can form an alliance

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.100
and get

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.900
all Six Realms under our control.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.060
Your father still lives.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.370
For Your Highness to say so...

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.300
My father is old.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.740
Besides,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.300
how do you view your own father?

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.300
We're not that different.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.450
With power and titles at stake,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.740
who wouldn't make plans?

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.180
Would you rather believe

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.060
in an old ruler nearing his end

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.130
or choose to side with someone who promises you a future?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.570
Since you're offering the Golden Millet Dream,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.330
there must be something else you want, right?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.570
At the tea gathering,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.060
if you manage to catch Ming Xian

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.300
and figure out her true identity,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.570
I'd like you to bring her to me first.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.490
Trying to earn some credit in front of your father, are you?

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.180
This is my gift for you, Lord Chengyun.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.810
Such power...

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.010
Your Highness, you've truly changed.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.740
If you are happy with this gift, Lord Chengyun,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.890
about what I just said...

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.690
It's a deal.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.380
Come and take a look!

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.930
We have all kinds of styles available.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.540
Come on.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.730
This way, please.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.380
All right.

After Mu Qibai tricked me

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.180
into handing Ji Bozai the Netherbeast-Luring Caltrop,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.730
Tianji assigned me a task.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.020
We're heading to Yaoguang Mountain soon.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.660
I need to complete it first.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.660
Otherwise,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.540
I might cause trouble for others again.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.300
What task?

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.780
To practice discernment.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.610
Learn how to handle situations.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.570
Scenario one: You're late to the tea gathering,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.210
and a Yaoguang Mountain warrior says,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.500
"How nice of you.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.330
You didn't show up for the meal,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.780
but you came to pay the bill."

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.450
What do you say?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.780
"So you came early

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.020
just to avoid paying the bill?"

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.730
What a brilliant, sarcastic remark.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.500
Was I being sarcastic?

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.780
I didn't mean to.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.930
Scenario two:

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.060
Tianji buys tea and snacks for everyone

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.900
but leaves you out.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.540
What do you do?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.850
Tianji would never do that.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.330
You're that confident?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.180
Scenario three:

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.450
The Emperor of Zhushui sees you

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.970
at the tea gathering and says,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.330
"The youth are impressive.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.850
Looks like I'm really getting old."

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.020
How do you respond?

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.780
The Emperor of Zhushui is over 100 years old.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.540
He really is old.

[Jade Rabbit Hall]

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.660
Can you two

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.610
stop laughing now?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.780
Even your poses are the same.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.450
I didn't want to keep bothering you,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.180
so I asked someone else to help me practice discernment.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.380
Is that really so funny?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.300
Yes, it is.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.900
All right, come on, sit down.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.180
Sit down.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.540
Listen to me.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.690
If you keep practicing,

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.570
you'll definitely

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.090
improve over time.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.140
I believe in you.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.020
But I'm so worried.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.660
I caused so much trouble for Ji Bozai last time.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.420
At the tea gathering,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.610
if someone from Yaoguang Mountain

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.970
asks you to pass something to Ji Bozai like last time,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.060
will you still do it without hesitation?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.260
Of course not.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.090
I'll check it at least eight or ten times first.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.970
That's the spirit!

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.210
See? You've made great progress.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.420
Right.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.090
It seems my recent efforts have paid off.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.180
I'll go find Chen Xi to help me practice more.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.090
See you.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.690
By the way, this is for you.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.180
It's just a habit of mine. I wanted to make you happy.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.380
Of course I'm happy.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.430
Silly.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.570
Thanks.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.060
We three will always be the best of friends,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.700
right?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.580
Of course.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.180
Of course.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.100
Here.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.820
One candy for each of my good friends.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.200
[Pure and Noble Spirit]

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.250
On the way,

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.580
quiz me some more.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.580
No problem.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.610
Can the boat carriage carry all this stuff?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.580
No matter how much, it'll fit.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.820
Be careful, Chen Xi.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.890
I've read about so many places

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.650
in Yaoguang Mountain

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.100
to eat good food and have fun.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.580
There's even a market

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.370
that only opens around the Sunlight Festival at Yaoguang Mountain.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.530
It's said to be a must-visit spot for the immortal couples there.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.730
Let's share a boat carriage together,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.060
and I'll tell you all about it.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.420
Are you sure I need you to tell me about it?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.060
Right, I forgot you were from Yaoguang Mountain.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.460
She's taking my boat carriage.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.490
Immortal Ji, I know

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.530
you don't want to be apart from her for a single moment,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.420
but you should still ask her what she wants.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.100
Of course.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.130
But Fairy Zhang Tai,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.180
I want to ask Ming Yi about...

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.490
some matters regarding artifacts.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.770
That's right.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.250
I've always been very interested in artifacts.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.010
And since, to the outside world,

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.250
she's still my wife,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.850
traveling with me

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.010
will prevent anyone from suspecting her identity,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.850
right?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.060
That's hard to refute.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.820
But I've seen through you.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.300
I still want to share a boat carriage with you.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.530
- We'll get there in no time. - Master,

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.580
we've finished moving the luggage.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.530
Well done, Chen Xi.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.100
At this tea gathering,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.060
I count on you to fight for Jixing Abyss.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.300
It will be fraught with danger,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.300
so be careful, everyone.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.100
I will pray for you in Jixing Abyss.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.820
May stars and blessings forever grace the Abyss.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.420
[Yaoguang Palace, Yaoguang Mountain]

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.850
The first event of the tea gathering

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.650
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.580
The spiritual power stone will assess

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.890
each warrior's spiritual power level

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.490
so the others can adjust their strategies accordingly.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.580
I heard the test would be followed by a travelers' competition.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.180
Warriors can't participate.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.420
This year's prize is a black lingzhi mushroom,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.420
which is especially rare.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.130
I really want to check it out.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.580
You only think about having fun.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.220
We're here for business.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.300
I know.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.700
Immortal Ji,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.250
what should we do next?

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.220
Yan Xiao, Meng Yangqiu,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.420
go to the warriors' base

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.770
and report the list of warriors for the test.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.770
Chen Xi,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.770
come help me check the artifacts we brought.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.250
Yes, Immortal Ji.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.940
Ming Yi.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.420
No tasks for you for now. Get some rest.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.650
Your Lordship, aren't you worried you'll end up with nothing?

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.890
I gave her the Golden Millet Dream

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.460
to keep her alive,

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.010
not for anything else.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.010
Hesitation suggests fear.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.250
What I want

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.490
is for her to choose me

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.890
despite the many difficulties.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.100
But what if she doesn't dare?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.820
She is Ming Xian.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.370
What is there to fear?

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.580
She just needs time to understand.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.670
Then...

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.300
Enough. The competition begins tomorrow.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.250
Don't you have somewhere to be?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:34.980
Understood.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.900
[Border of Zhushui Spiritual State]

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.700
This man used to be a warrior of our realm.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.770
He made a mistake at the Qingyun Two-Realm Tournament.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.810
The Emperor of Zhushui

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.420
sentenced him to be bitten by a fish monster in the stomach

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.010
and stripped him of his warrior status.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.330
After that, he went completely mad.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.810
How many more vagrants like this

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.770
are there?

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.220
A hundred and thirty-two.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.730
That's still not enough to make me more powerful.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.250
I'll think of another way.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.530
Your Lordship...

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.980
Freshly baked pastries and buns!

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.980
Make way!

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.980
I don't know how strong the other warriors are

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.250
at this tea gathering,

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.860
but we must not take things lightly.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.420
What are you doing sneaking around?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.730
I took the wrong path.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.570
Stop right there!

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.920
It's all a misunderstanding!

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.570
They're fighting.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.700
She's my friend.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.420
I asked her to come find me.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.380
Why...

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.940
why are you here?

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.980
Of course I came.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.220
I wrote you so many letters,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.090
but every time, you replied so perfunctorily

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.420
with phrases like "got it" or "I see."

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.460
I...

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.900
I...

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.420
Don't tell me

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.460
you're married!

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.760
If you are,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.810
I'll definitely expose you.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.490
It's not like that.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.730
Really.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.220
I'm just not good with words,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.980
so I've been focusing on training,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.140
hoping to win the Blessed Rain first

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.940
so I can give you a stable life.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.700
That's the only reason?

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.380
Yes.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.660
I knew it!

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.380
You like me!

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.330
Of course.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.900
Preparing for the test

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.220
won't take too much time.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.220
We rarely get a chance to leave Jixing Abyss.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.140
We should take this opportunity to look around.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.290
Come take a look, young immortal.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.810
These artifacts are finely crafted.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.250
Pick one you like.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.980
I'll buy it for you.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.330
No merit, no reward.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.530
Just choose one.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.900
You helped Yangqiu practice discernment earlier,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.490
so you're half his master.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.570
Think of this as his tuition fee.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.250
What do you say?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.140
But...

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.580
No buts.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.980
Pick whichever you like.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.260
All right, then I'll pick one.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.950
Go ahead.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.980
The night market at Yaoguang Mountain is always bustling.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.090
I remember there was a scallion pancake stall there.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.660
I used to go every day.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.140
Even the owner

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.090
remembered how I liked my pancake.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.900
It's all thanks to your seven consecutive victories

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.620
that Yaoguang Mountain is so prosperous.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.700
I didn't realize until I came to Jixing Abyss

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.660
that when some are laughing,

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.290
others are crying.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.010
This one's really easy to keep alive.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.620
Sir, we'll leave these here.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.490
Yaoguang Mountain truly is wonderful.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.530
When will Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.460
ever be this prosperous?

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.770
Even the artifacts at the market are top-notch.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.570
Yeah.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.770
Once we finish our work

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:44.620
and get paid,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.380
we can buy new artifacts.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.810
Let's take a look there.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.810
Are you the younger brother of Immortal Xu Yun from Jixing Abyss,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.860
Chen Xi?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.700
Chen Xi?

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.900
Wow,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.860
you've grown so much in just two years!

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.530
Exactly!

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.660
Uncle Xiao, Uncle Tai!

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.410
You came to the tea gathering this year too?

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.210
- Yes. - Yes.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.970
If you like this dagger,

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.490
I'll give it to you.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.930
To be honest, we...

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.970
we can't afford it.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.900
Our realms keep losing at the Qingyun Tournament,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.100
and we've been living in hardship.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.650
If your brother hadn't gifted us artifacts two years ago,

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.690
we probably wouldn't have even qualified for the warrior selection.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.970
That's true.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.300
Since you're Chen Xi's friends,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.380
you're my friends too.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.730
I'll buy this dagger for you.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.450
Thank you for your kindness,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.450
but that won't be necessary.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.650
Once we finish our work and get paid,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.250
we'll buy one ourselves.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.690
Then let me help you.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:57.650
- No... - No need.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.580
That won't do.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.780
You'll dirty your clothes.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.900
Don't worry about that.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.340
With the Blessed Rain unevenly distributed,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.820
it's hard for the Lower Realms to rise up.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.380
The Six Realms should help each other out.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.010
We'll get the work done in no time.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.620
Once we're done, food's on me.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.490
Still thinking

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.380
about the warriors from Mangfu Swamp and Cangwu Hill?

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.900
Yes.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.450
When I was at Yaoguang Mountain,

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.340
I had no idea

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.140
that in the Lower Realms,

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.690
even the warriors struggled so much.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.820
How hard life must be for ordinary people.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.900
Where there are victors, there must also be losers.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.100
The Qingyun Tournament may seem fair,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.490
but in reality, it creates a vicious cycle.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.210
The Lower Three Realms lack Blessed Rain

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.140
and suffer from a loss of talent.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.780
As time goes on,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.690
the gap just keeps growing wider,

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.780
and the beings in those realms

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.250
sink deeper into hardship.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.300
The strong keep getting stronger.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.340
Whether Jixing Abyss or Yaoguang Mountain

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.210
takes first place,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.100
it won't change the situation.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.410
If only the rules of the Qingyun Tournament

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.900
could be changed someday,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.690
and the Blessed Rain could be shared equally

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.860
among all Six Realms.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.930
Why are you smiling?

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.650
I know, human nature is fickle.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.580
Maybe I'll change my mind one day.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.900
I'm being too idealistic.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.780
I'm smiling because we,

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.100
who once fought against each other at the Qingyun Tournament,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.780
are now having this conversation.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.860
But you're right.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.060
If we don't dream,

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.620
that day will never come.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.010
In truth, the beings of the Lower Three Realms

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.900
don't care who wins first place at all.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.930
All they want is the Blessed Rain,

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.820
enough to eat, and clothes

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.450
to keep warm.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.410
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.450
I saw countless people who wanted to live

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.730
but had to twist their own will to survive.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.250
It wasn't their fault.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.250
They just wanted

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.540
to live too badly.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.820
You've gone through so much in the past.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.860
Thank you

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.010
for holding on and surviving,

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.780
or I wouldn't have met you now.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.490
You once said you had a mark on your forehead.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.210
I think

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.250
my mother planted it there

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.690
when I was still an infant.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.170
It holds some vague memories of her.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.490
I can't see her face clearly,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.650
but she told me

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.580
this mark

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.450
was formed from her blood and mine.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.900
Haven't you ever thought about looking for her?

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.900
Of course I have.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.340
When I was in the Sunken Abyss,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.860
I imagined countless times

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.690
that they'd come looking for me.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.860
But perhaps

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.490
they are no longer alive.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.490
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.570
What matters is

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.980
that I had my master

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.250
who saved me and guided me.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.700
I have Buxiu who respects me

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.140
and Granny Xun who cares for me.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.730
And then there is you.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.380
What about me?

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.730
You lied to me.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.250
Ji Bozai, I...

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.180
I'll give you one more chance to say it.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.810
You love me.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.700
♪May this life be as fleeting as a firefly's glow♪

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.260
♪Yet love may once again find its way back through time♪

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.500

[Tea gathering of Qingyun Tournament]

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:03.860
- Yes. - Right.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.090
Rest assured.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.810
All right.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.090
Do you have faith in yourself?

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.730
The first event of the tea gathering

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.420
is tomorrow's spiritual power test.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.530
The spiritual power stone will assess

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.250
each warrior's spiritual power level

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.420
so the others can adjust their strategies accordingly.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.770
But doesn't that mean exposing one's own strength?

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.090
Yes,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.380
and no.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.420
First up,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.050
a warrior from Flowing Wave Gorge.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.530
The Qingyun Tournament is fought in teams.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.900
Within each team, there are naturally warriors of varying strength.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.050
Those with greater power can choose to conceal it

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.770
and act

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.330
as hidden trump cards during the actual match.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.530
What if

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.250
everyone hides their strength?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.280
Those who do are usually evenly matched and rely on surprise tactics

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.250
to win.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.900
But like Yaoguang Mountain in the past, Zhushui Spiritual State

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.050
doesn't bother with that.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.490
They send out their strongest warriors

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.460
to display their power

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.620
and crush the opponents' will before the fight even begins.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.220
Next, a fighter from Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.380
[Chao Yan, Fourth Prince of Zhushui]

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.010
Impressive.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.860
Indeed.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.980
When Jixing Abyss was still one of the Lower Realms,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.900
our warriors, after seeing the strength of Yaoguang Mountain's warriors

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.980
at the tea gathering, would expect defeat

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.220
before the fight even began.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.530
Now, a warrior from Jixing Abyss.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.620
He looks like a fool,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.940
but his spiritual power is surprisingly strong.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.460
- Exactly. - Right.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.980
That's the warrior without spiritual veins, right?

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.620
What's so special about him...

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.860
- No idea. - That he gets to join the Qingyun Tournament?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.620
I wonder.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.380
I heard he had exceptional healing skills.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.620
The Empress of Jixing really does have an eye for talent.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.420
True,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.050
or she never would've discovered Ji Bozai.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.940
That kid's impressive.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.900
Yes.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.810
He's got real potential.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.050
He reminds me of Ming Xian back in the day.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.490
Indeed.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.090
I'm confident.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.700
We've got Immortal Ji

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.330
and Master Ming Yi, who can forge all kinds of artifacts.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.900
Even so, don't get cocky.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.940
Overconfidence leads to defeat.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:31:59.900
Remember that.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.420
Oh my.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.330
He's incredible.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.140
- Remarkable indeed. - Impressive!

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.730
- Amazing! - Wonderful!

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.770
- Excellent! - Impressive!

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.530
So impressive.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.900
As expected of Immortal Ji!

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.810
Impressive!

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.330
Indeed.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.330
Whoever faces him is doomed.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.530
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang Mountain is here!

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.980
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.620
Now that Ming Xin is the Crown Prince,

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.530
he sure makes quite an entrance.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.730
Yeah, no kidding.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.050
What's he showing off for?

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.250
He lost miserably last year.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.530
He's been competing for years,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.860
but his strength is just average.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:15.940
Exactly.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.980
Amazing, Your Highness!

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.660
Truly incredible.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.660
- That was impressive. - Yes.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.490
Such power!

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.330
What kind of elixir did he take to get that strong?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.730
- Right. - Oh my.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.050
Unbelievable!

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.220
Ming Xin is about to reach the Transcendent Stage?

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.620
How is that possible?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.180
Even his mother, Lady Meng, once said

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.490
he didn't have the talent

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.770
to reach such a level.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.770
Perhaps

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.460
someone's helping him.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.900
Ming Xin acted strangely at the tea gathering.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.570
It seems he has already realized who you are.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.690
From the way he looked at me, I think he has.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.860
But right now, what matters most

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.420
is the travelers' competition tonight.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.170
I must win the black lingzhi mushroom

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.380
to bring Twenty-Seven back.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.570
Due to the rules,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.490
as a warrior, I can't compete,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.010
and you shouldn't show yourself either,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.980
or Ming Xin might get suspicious.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.570
So,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.740
I want to ask Buxiu to help.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.900
So the great Warrior Goddess already has a plan?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.690
In that case,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.010
let's restore our heart imprints first.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.820
If Ming Xin makes a move

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.860
and you're in danger,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.130
I'll be able to reach you in time.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.780
You drive a hard bargain, don't you?

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.570
Ming Yi,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.980
what happened to your hand?

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.820
Nothing.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.610
Either way, we should restore our heart imprints.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.100
You're just taking advantage of the fact that our names are still

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.050
on the Marriage Stone.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.940
Did I agree to do this?

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.610
So what if you didn't?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.460
I got what I wanted.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.610
Smarty-pants.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.210
- Incredible! - How many has he beaten now?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.570
This immortal has already defeated

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.740
725 opponents

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.490
without a single loss.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.260
That many?

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.780
Does anyone else want to challenge him?

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.380
Anyone?

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.380
If no one can defeat him,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.800
the prize will go to this immortal.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.260
I'll be taking it, then.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.160
Please.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.340
Where did they go?

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.170
They vanished!

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.570
The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.980
It's really gone!

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.940
The black lingzhi mushroom is gone too!

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.490
Yeah, what happened?

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.820
Just as Your Lordship and Fairy Ming Yi predicted,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.820
the lingzhi mushroom disappeared.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.740
Someone attacked, and Ming Yi was taken.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.980
It must have been Ming Xin.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.610
Your Lordship, aren't you going to do anything?

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.380
She can handle it.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.090
I have faith in her.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.130
Ming Xian.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.300
For your cat to come back to life,

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.340
you'll need a black lingzhi mushroom.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.210
I knew you'd bite the hook

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.340
with this as the bait.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.940
Let's see

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.530
if you have what it takes to snatch it from me.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.380
Back then, you were obsessed with forbidden arts

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.980
and drew countless designs for magical artifacts.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.010
When the Empress found out, she confiscated them.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.650
Now that I've gone through them,

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.780
I must say, they're quite useful.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.900
Perfect

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.460
for dealing with you,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.090
Ming Xian.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.650
What's that supposed to mean?

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.570
Trying to make me think

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.820
my mother is behind all this?

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.010
You think such cheap tricks

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.010
would work on me?

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.490
Of course the Empress wouldn't harm you.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.420
You're her most useful pawn.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.340
What dark spell did she use back then

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.860
to turn you into a man?

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.610
Even your face

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.050
looked completely different.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:03.570
The Crown Prince of Yaoguang, whom I hated for so many years,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.340
turns out to be a woman.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.340
How revolting.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.460
It's a pity you don't know

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.860
how I gave you the Heavenly Grief.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.740
I slipped it into the scallion pancake

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.340
the Empress herself made for you before the Qingyun Tournament.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.530
You're insane!

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.090
How dare you show up at the tea gathering

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.690
with people from Jixing Abyss, our enemy?

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.780
Once I bring you to that person...

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.090
Spiritual power from Zhushui Spiritual State?

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.090
Did the Emperor of Zhushui give it to you?

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.090
No wonder your power surged at the tea gathering.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.010
Who are you taking me to?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.530
The Emperor of Zhushui?

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.570
So you were faking it all along!
