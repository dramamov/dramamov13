00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.900
[Episode 3]

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.759
Cheng is already gone.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.340
Why are you still lingering here?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.400
You're free now.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.120
Go wherever

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.509
you want to go.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.710
Off you go.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.570
Go!

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.060
Father,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.290
this Yan Whistle is so hard to pick up.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560
Then I'll give you this wooden whistle.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.220
Before you learn
how to use the Yan Whistle,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.139
just try this wooden one instead, alright?

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.200
Thank you, Father.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.450
What are you doing here?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.860
Get lost!

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.710
I've just lost my son.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.440
I only want some time by myself.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.520
I've been sickly since childhood.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.760
When I was busking with my father
to make a living,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.750
I once saw two wild geese that got lost.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.079
They looked like a father and his son.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.440
The northern land was freezing cold.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.840
The old goose froze to death
on the mudflat.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.340
The young goose

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.890
hovered around the old one's body,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.079
over and over again,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.970
until my father

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.610
dug a hole and buried the old goose.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.160
We people of Yanmen all know

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.360
that wild geese are
the most affectionate creatures.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.840
Yeah,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.710
wild geese are truly affectionate.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.510
When I saw those two geese,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.760
it was already the last month of winter.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.130
The young goose was too weak to fly south.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.430
A few days later,

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.570
a cold wave suddenly swept in,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.990
and it followed the old goose's path
and passed away.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.850
That was just foolish filial piety.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.680
♪ I cross the Yan River in the wasteland ♪

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.120
But I understand it.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.840
Since I was young,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.550
my father's been busking to raise me.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.430
♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.120
Even before he passed away,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.620
I was still the one
he worried about the most.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.870
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.800
So

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.770
I made a deal and married Hao Wenhou.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.329
♪ Look down on my dream ♪

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560
How could you be so foolish?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.030
Your father wouldn't

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.240
want you to do this.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.890
Only a father

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.470
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.800
understands a father's good intentions.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.360
But only children

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.800
can understand

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.890
a child's deep affection
for their parents.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.430
♪ Destiny entwining my fleeting life,
I can't fight ♪

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.430
How could I let my father

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.430
die in the wilderness
without being properly buried?

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.579
♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.990
Before Mr. Jiang passed away,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.150
he was so concerned
about the Yanmen Sect's reputation

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.600
that he even sacrificed his own life
to protect it.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.720
He cared about everything

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.800
that his father cared about

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.120
more than his own life.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.520
Silly boy.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.720
Why couldn't he understand

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.260
that his life

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.430
was actually what mattered most to me?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.940
We all do what we believe is right

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.750
for the sake of our family.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.320
But is that really good?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.860
You also don't want to leave Yanmen

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.830
and me, right?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.750
Cheng.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680
Cheng!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.320
Breezes sweep through the fields of reed;

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.320
moonlight scatters on Mount Huaxi.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.390
Mr. Tang,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.300
nice to meet you.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.120
I am Feng Chuanxiang.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.430
Mr. Tang,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.320
what's wrong?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.240
Isn't it?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.480
I'm sorry.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.210
My friend just passed away.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.600
I'm not in the mood

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.330
to appreciate the scenery yet.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.760
Mr. Tang, I heard that you

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.990
were the last person

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.810
to see Jiang Cheng before his death.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.240
Before Jiang Cheng passed away,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.950
I was indeed

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.450
the only one by his side.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.480
Master Jiang is suffering
from the sudden loss of his son.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.540
He had you arrested

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.230
and put you through all this.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.510
I hope you won't mind.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.600
Mr. Feng, that's so kind of you.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.480
Haven't they told you

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.830
that I've already confessed

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.160
to killing Jiang Cheng?

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.510
I brought this upon myself.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.860
It's just fair.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.080
I don't know

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.240
why you would take

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.500
such blame upon yourself,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.980
but...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.400
Judging by what you said,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.950
you're so sure

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.520
that I'm not the killer?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.310
Yes.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.700
Because you were not

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.909
the one who poisoned him.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.159
Why did they

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.820
release us?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.970
What happened?

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.270
Because Mr. Feng

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.540
vouched for Mr. Tang.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.760
Master Jiang's got no trust in us,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.240
but plenty in Mr. Feng.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.430
You mean

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.200
Feng Chuanxiang, the one who went missing?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.630
Yes.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.000
I suppose the news of his disappearance

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.120
was just a rumor.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.830
But thankfully, he arrived in time.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.160
Things turned out fine.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.180
I came here

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.040
to catch the real culprit

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.090
and avenge my friend's death.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.580
Please help me, Mr. Tang.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.400
What's in it for me?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.110
If we catch the real culprit,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.510
you'll naturally be cleared of suspicion.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.490
That's not a benefit.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.360
Indeed.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.300
Even if I hadn't appeared,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.720
you'd still find a way to escape for sure.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.060
But from what I know,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.909
Mr. Tang,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.320
you were first involved

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.200
in the massacre of Hao Wenhou's family.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.510
After leaving the temple,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.120
you soon became

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.179
the prime suspect in Cheng's murder.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.970
Mr. Tang,

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.740
even if you escape from Yanmen,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.720
how can you be sure it won't happen again?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.360
Do you really want

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.750
to leave a trail of false accusations

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.720
wherever you go

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.870
and end up
as an enemy of the whole jianghu?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.960
Mr. Feng,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.560
you sure are well-informed.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.400
After all these years in the jianghu,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.720
I've made quite a few friends.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.250
If you have so many friends,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.680
why do you specifically ask for my help?

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.540
Because this time, the enemy is

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.750
way more powerful than we thought.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.470
"We"?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.300
Yes,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.300
we.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.630
I believe

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.960
we have a common enemy.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.850
Chi.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.980
You're awake.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.640
Where are

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.620
those damn brutes from the Yanmen Sect?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.880
Master Jiang's taken the Yanmen disciples

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.680
back already.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.980
They just left?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.750
So easily?

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.750
Before Master Jiang left,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.810
he set a condition.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.260
Within seven days,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.790
Mr. Tang must help Mr. Feng

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.000
investigate how Young Master Jiang

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.150
ended up taking the Blood Ghost Pill

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.960
and figure out the truth

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.090
for the Yanmen Sect.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.050
I'll go ask him about it.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.960
I can only drink this much today.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.120
If Jiang Cheng were still alive,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.890
we would definitely
share another pot of wine with you

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.750
and drink to our hearts' content.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.010
I didn't expect

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160
you to hold

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.370
your liquor so well.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.260
I'm not much of a drinker.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.790
It's just that when drinking
with a kindred spirit,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.190
even a thousand cups of wine are
not enough.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.580
Really?

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.760
You two just met each other,

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.050
and now you're already kindred spirits?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.030
I never knew that you, Foxy Tang,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.970
were so passionate about making friends.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.640
Mr. Chi.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.020
Don't call me that.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.700
Just call me Chi Yun.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.800
Or

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.490
Master Chi,

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.350
Chief Chi,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.510
any of those will do.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.630
Alright.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.400
We still have things to do today.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.620
We need some good tea

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.430
to sober up.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.080
Indeed, you're right.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.030
But I

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.610
don't have any tea with me.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.470
Now

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.010
it's not appropriate
to ask Master Jiang for some.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.070
Don't worry, Feng.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.190
I have some.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.280
Chi Yun,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.440
serve the tea.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.170
You want me

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.150
to pour tea for him?

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.010
Are you reluctant to do it?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.250
I refuse.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.380
Fine.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.830
It hurts again?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.740
Then why did you drink so much?

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:31.870
Why did you act

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.910
all buddy-buddy with a stranger

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.360
who came out of nowhere?

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.550
So

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.200
I want some good tea

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.240
to sober up.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.260
You sly fox.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.330
Just a minute.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.650
I'm just that petty.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.510
In the jianghu,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.390
kindred spirits are rare to meet,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.250
and true friends are hard to find.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.170
You two...

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.130
Feng, you're mistaken.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.670
He's not my friend,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.910
but my servant.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.940
Servant?

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.840
This is his contract of servitude.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:08.760
Mr. Feng,

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.360
I'm merely a lowly servant.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.460
How could I possibly deserve
to befriend Foxy Tang?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.320
Drink it.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.630
This is the private joke

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.160
between Cloud and Mr. Tang.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.950
I shall not comment on it.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.310
This tea is wonderfully fragrant.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.070
Thank you,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.510
Cloud.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.100
This is yours.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.720
Sorry for that, Feng.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.630
Miss Shei,

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.230
you've fitted in quite well.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.910
These are just some chores
within my ability.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.290
Now that things have settled down,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.290
we should sit down

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.320
and have a good, hearty meal.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.720
You're right.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.480
That's what we should do.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.910
Then let me help out, too.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.650
Miss Zhong.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.580
Your nose.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.780
Let me help you.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.680
There, done.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.380
Thank you, Miss Shei.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.490
I'd better not get in the way.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.550
It's fine.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.670
Miss Zhong, I'm already so happy

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.320
that you're willing to stay here with me.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.410
Your hands

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.150
are meant to fight evil.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.270
Just let me do these things.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.760
In just a few days,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.660
so many things have happened.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.960
You, a lone orphan girl,
have wandered so far.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.020
You must've suffered a lot.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.720
I used to travel with my father,
busking for a living.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.080
We've endured countless hardships.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.200
Now I can

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.670
stay in such a safe place

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.510
with warm clothes and abundant food.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.980
I'm already very fortunate.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.620
Besides,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.990
I can experience things

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.910
that I've never

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.910
seen before.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.570
Yes.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.370
I once thought

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.390
my trip down the mountain

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.300
representing
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.210
would be easy.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.620
It turned out that I was too naive.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.740
Speaking of which,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.170
I'm grateful to have met all of you.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.740
Thanks to you guys,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.500
all these tangled clues

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.240
have gradually come to light.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.470
And Master Tang.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.260
Although his way
of doing things is quite wild,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.320
it often yields remarkable results.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.560
It's truly admirable.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.330
Indeed.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.380
Mr. Tang

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.080
is a very special person.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.440
If you asked me a few days ago,

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.590
I couldn't imagine

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.000
that instead of being trapped

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.400
in seclusion in the Hao Residence forever,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.960
I'd be with a crew of wandering heroes,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960
going on adventures in the jianghu.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.670
Miss Zhong,

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.320
I owe all this to you

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.120
for saving me.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.070
Don't mention it.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.910
Actually,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.390
I've seen

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.630
a lot in the Jianghu.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.270
But I've never had

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.400
such a special experience as this one.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.730
It's thrilling

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.140
with twists and turns.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.200
I hope to uncover the truth soon

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.630
and return to the Sword Alliance
with credits,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.700
living up to my master's expectations.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.550
Yet I also wish

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.480
to delay our parting.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.240
Feng, you just mentioned

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.940
a beautiful scenic spot

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.750
where you and Jiang Cheng

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.760
live in seclusion. Where is it?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.750
At the end of Huaxi Stream,

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.810
beside Feng Cliff,

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.310
it's the Liulian Cottage.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.320
After we fulfill

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.540
our seven-day agreement with Master Jiang,

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.970
you can feel free to visit

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.480
my humble abode anytime

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.540
with your friends.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.760
Liulian Cottage.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.240
Feng,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.300
I have never seen

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.840
the morning view of Yan River.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.640
Would you like

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.000
to accompany me to the bow for a look?

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.210
With pleasure.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.260
The warm and gentle morning light.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.870
What an amazing view.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.580
Such a beautiful scene

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.530
is perfect...

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.300
It's perfect to wake people up.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.310
Mr. Tang, what are you doing?

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.820
Breaking my promise.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.550
Foxy Tang,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.420
what's happening?

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.360
Mr. Feng,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.230
I've heard your story.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.900
I'm somewhat interested,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.630
but not much.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.060
It's not worth the effort
I have to put in.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.750
I thought

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.540
you were someone

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.950
who cared about friends, Mr. Tang.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.290
I have no friends,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.040
so how would I care about them?

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.550
Mr. Feng,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.890
you got me wrong.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.790
But Mr. Tang...

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.790
No buts.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.960
He already told you

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960
he has no friends.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.310
You want to be friends

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.140
with this heartless fox?

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.510
You'll be eaten down to the bones

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.110
and die without knowing why!

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.710
Mr. Tang!

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.310
Just say whatever you want.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.040
What was that just now?

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.510
Weren't you two
getting along well last night?

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.440
Why did things suddenly turn sour?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.240
That day, Jiang Cheng told me

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.640
that the first person

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.700
who made him take the Blood Ghost Pill

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.560
was Feng Chuanxiang.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.280
No way!

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.770
Weren't they sworn brothers?

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.400
Chi Yun,

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.520
you've always hated evil guys.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.320
I was afraid you couldn't hold back.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.340
Yeah, I can't stand someone

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.740
who betrayed his friend.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.440
I'm going after him to check it out.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.100
If he really poisoned Jiang Cheng,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.500
I'll kill him right away!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.140
Where is Chi Yun going?

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.110
Miss Shei,

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.200
I need to follow him and take a look.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.230
I believe

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.260
we have a common enemy.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.690
What do you want to ask?

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.130
Sir, if you wanted Chi

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.240
to follow Mr. Feng,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.640
why didn't you say it directly?

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.270
Being instructed by others
and taking initiative on one's own

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.230
might seem the same to others.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.030
But for Chi Yun,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.490
there's a big difference.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.200
Most of the time,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.340
I prefer to let him maintain

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.690
a pleasant mood.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.780
I thought

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.400
you would ask another question.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.290
What?

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.780
The hand.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.210
Yesterday,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.550
you saw me get injured

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.420
and saw the wound heal with your own eyes.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.490
Aren't you curious?

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.820
I just think

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.680
that maybe

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.550
everyone has

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.680
secrets they want to keep from others.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.570
You're very clever, miss,

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.030
but unfortunately,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.640
you've overlooked

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.190
a very important fact.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.720
Chi Yun and Ms. Zhong

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.980
have both left the ship to track someone.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.990
Now, there are

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.770
only you and me left on this ship.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.090
Miss Shei,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:33.920
didn't the person

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.320
who sent you ever tell you

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.110
how dangerous Tang Lici is?

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.440
Miss Shei,

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.030
you are

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.930
the only survivor from the Hao Residence,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.670
as well as the witness chosen by Liu Yan.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.190
Tell me

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.930
why my friend Liu Yan

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.670
chose you?

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.400
I don't know,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.350
Mr. Tang.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.340
I'm sorry.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.210
I was being rude.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.920
Mr. Tang,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.880
your apology

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.270
isn't sincere at all.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.310
Because you don't care

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.910
whether I forgive you or not.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.090
To get the truth you want,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.110
you even

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.440
tested me in the most brutal way

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.410
without a care

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.700
for others' feelings.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.160
Yet someone like you

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.720
is willing to meddle

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.920
in the affairs of Mr. Feng and Mr. Jiang.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.770
Could you tell me

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.190
why?

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.660
Liu Yan did leave you by my side

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.110
for some reason.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.340
What?

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.010
Come with me.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.200
Where is he?

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.050
He should be around here.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.880
Mr. Feng!

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.980
Mr. Jiang.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.240
Mr. Feng,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.140
how did you fall into the water?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.580
Come on,

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.580
sit down quickly.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:39.490
Here you are.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:40.200
Put this on.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.000
Jiang Qingyu?

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.960
Why is he here?

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.630
Mr. Feng,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.620
how did you end up in the water?

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.010
Also,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.930
where's Mr. Tang?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.960
Mr. Tang suddenly turned against me

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.090
and backed out of our cooperation.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.550
So

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.020
he used you and then abandoned you?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:57.980
Mr. Jiang,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.130
what brings you here?

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.720
I'm here

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.790
for Cheng's case.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.340
Given what you said yesterday,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.160
there's more behind Cheng's taking

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.070
that evil pill?

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.970
That's right.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.930
I suspect

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.660
that he was poisoned.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.010
What?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360
Darn it.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.700
How despicable!

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.090
What do you plan to do next, Mr. Feng?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.650
Jiang Cheng was my best friend.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.170
I will definitely

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.150
bring the poisoner to justice

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.420
and make him pay with his life.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.240
Cheng was fortunate to have a friend

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.720
like you, Mr. Feng.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.440
Would you allow me to come along

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.200
with you?

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:43.650
Our Yanmen Sect

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.110
has some connections

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.850
in both legal and underworld communities.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.050
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.120
That would be perfect.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.580
Let's go then.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.730
We should hurry and find a place

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.310
to dry your clothes first.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:55.800
Let's go.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.200
Okay.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.350
Forget about whether Feng Chuanxiang

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.610
is suspicious for now.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.310
Why is Mr. Jiang Qingyu
even more dedicated to it

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.840
than Jiang Cheng's father?

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.410
Something's off.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.680
I need to look into it.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.660
What are you doing? Are you going bonkers?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.650
Keep up.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.370
Where are we?

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.490
Huaxi.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.720
The place where Young Mr. Jiang

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.270
and Mr. Feng once lived.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:33.640
Mr. Tang,

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.200
didn't you say

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.730
you wouldn't help Mr. Feng?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.440
Or are you planning

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.280
to split up with Chi Yun

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.480
and investigate the case

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.480
about Young Master Jiang together?

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.270
You were right about the beginning,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.800
but wrong about the ending.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.270
I did break

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.000
my promise to Feng Chuanxiang.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:49.750
However,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.140
I came here

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.310
because Shisan Tower

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.640
revealed the clues leading to this place.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.360
[Jin Hua Yin]

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.270
Sorry for the delay.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.720
Sirs,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.610
here's your tea.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.160
Since we know

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.220
he's the poisoner,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.700
why don't we arrest him?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960
I am impatient,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.710
but I'm not a fool.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.460
My keen instincts

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.170
tell me

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.510
that something fishy is going on here.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.680
Mr. Feng,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.680
my big brother is hot-tempered.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.440
If he finds out

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.590
that you let Tang Lici escape...

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.000
Sir!

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.550
He might

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.550
do crazy things.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.720
Alright!

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.100
Mr. Jiang, have you figured out

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.900
a better plan?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.320
Shisan Tower? What kind of place is that?

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.970
A place
where you can find answers to everything.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.790
Shisan Tower has the world's

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.320
most formidable assassins

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.160
and the most comprehensive intelligence
in the jianghu.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.960
But you need to afford the price.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.400
Then where is this tower?

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.440
Shisan Tower's location is so mysterious

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.170
that few in the jianghu know it.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.720
But if you wish to make a deal with them,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.450
you should go to their outpost,

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.270
Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.300
[Floating Abyss]

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.410
If you still want to keep
these eyes of yours,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.030
I suggest you stop looking
where you shouldn't.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.230
I've heard that the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.530
has the most skilled assassins
in the world

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.270
and the most comprehensive information.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.830
So this must be

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.490
the Floating Abyss of Buhuan Tower.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.920
Then where is the Fallen Shisan Tower?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.720
Ms. Zhong,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480
do you know why

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.850
it's called the Floating Abyss
of Buhuan Tower?

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.310
That's because this place

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:36.850
really floats.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.620
What does that mean?

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.590
On the fifteenth of every month,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.050
which happens to be today,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.890
which happens to be right now.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.010
[Floating Abyss, Buhuan Tower]

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.410
It will rise from this part of the river.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.030
That's when

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.690
you can go up this Buhuan Tower

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.220
to make a deal
with the Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.930
As for seeing

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.220
the real Shisan Tower,

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.010
your qualifications

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.100
are not enough yet.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.780
Come on,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.980
why must I lie in a coffin?

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.910
I don't understand.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.390
If that's the case,

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.270
Mr. Tang,

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.060
why don't you go directly to Shisan Tower

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.960
to buy the truth about Young Master Jiang

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.200
and Mr. Feng?

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.870
Liu Yan arranged all these incidents

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.210
just to make me, while being pushed

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.070
by the Yanmen Sect relentlessly,

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.030
have no choice

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.600
but to go to Shisan Tower again
to buy information

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.930
and prove my innocence.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.460
But I surrendered willingly.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.860
This disrupted his plan.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.940
So

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.170
he sent Feng Chuanxiang.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.270
As long as I don't play along

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.550
with his plan,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.890
he just can't win this round.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.510
So that's why you

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.240
kicked Mr. Feng into the water.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.590
But why would Mr. Feng

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.480
take orders from Liu Yan?

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.440
That's

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.970
the purpose of our journey.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.890
The affairs in the jianghu

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.510
are truly bewildering

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.480
and creepy.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.280
Sorry for the interruption.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.080
When entering someone's home,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.460
it's only polite to announce yourself.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.220
[The flowers and the moon
decorate the river with breezes]

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.610
In your opinion,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.110
between Jiang Cheng and Feng Chuanxiang,

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.940
which one was telling the truth?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Jiang Cheng said

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.480
Feng Chuanxiang poisoned him.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.240
A person might lie

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.310
at any time,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.080
but they would never lie at death's door,

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.600
especially about their unfulfilled wishes.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.360
Mr. Tang...

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.310
Therefore,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.500
Jiang Cheng's words must be true.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.920
As for Feng Chuanxiang,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.030
he can lie,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.240
and he can hide

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.350
hatred and murderous intent

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.110
in a clever way

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.240
to go undetected.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.020
But a place where someone has lived

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.020
for a long time

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.110
will leave traces,
and those traces tell the truth.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.850
Especially when it comes to friendship.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.660
Even if one can fake it for a day

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.070
or for ten days,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.140
how could he possibly pretend

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.140
every single day?

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:37.000
The flowers and the moon decorate
the river (Jiang) with breezes (Feng).

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.810
They both

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.590
told the truth.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.650
But what kind of misunderstanding

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.260
could make such good friends

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.400
unable to talk it over face-to-face?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.110
Since they both

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.970
told the truth,

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.140
there must be a misunderstanding

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:51.750
they couldn't talk about,

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.090
nor was there a chance to explain.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.970
When suppressing the poison
for Jiang Cheng,

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.820
I found that the toxins
had accumulated in his body

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.120
for possibly more than a year.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.760
Therefore, over six months ago,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.290
when Jiang Cheng came
to see Feng Chuanxiang,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.510
he was already poisoned

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.970
with the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.920
But he himself

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.720
was completely unaware of this.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.120
In order to help

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.780
delay the poison's outbreak,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.810
Feng Chuanxiang

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.250
had to make him
keep taking the evil pills

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.850
by mixing them into his food in secret.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.190
Unfortunately,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.870
Jiang Cheng happened to witness this.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.030
So

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.080
a misunderstanding arose.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.510
I was already wondering

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.960
why Shisan Tower sent clues

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.570
about Liulian Cottage's murder

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.300
after the Hao family massacre.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.140
Now I'm even more convinced

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.530
that from the very beginning,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.590
not a single thing was coincidental.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:42.310
But

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.200
you already knew

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.670
that everything they said was true.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.310
You also knew
that your getting involved in this

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.770
was part of Liu Yan's plan.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:48.510
Why

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.840
did you still come here?

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.410
All of this is merely

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.370
my speculation.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.950
As for whether it's true or not,

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.350
and whether to join the game
or overturn it,

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.390
I'll find out once I investigate.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.850
Tang Lici,

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.010
you're doing very well.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:14.890
Tonight's guests of Buhuan Tower

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.290
have all arrived, right?

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.890
You know what to do.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.670
Trade for hands!

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.540
Sell one of your hands

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.680
for whatever information you want.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.740
What is this place?

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.640
Why is there a market here?

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.070
This is

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.990
the black market
in Buhuan Tower's Floating Abyss.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.600
If ordinary people want help
from Shisan Tower,

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.000
they must first come to the Floating Abyss

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.130
and find the Porter.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.200
But not everyone is qualified

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.270
to meet the Porter.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.000
Over time,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.970
a black market has formed here.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.400
Those who aren't qualified

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400
to meet the Porter

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.640
can still

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.990
buy what they want here.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.780
It's way too crowded here.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.210
And they're all wearing
the same black cloaks.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.410
Chi Yun, walk faster.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.530
Don't lose them.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.070
Oh, no, they really disappeared.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:19.690
Calm down.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.990
When the time comes,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.310
we'll meet them

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.240
near the Porter.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.270
Wait,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.050
didn't you just say

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.830
not everyone is qualified

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:29.890
to meet the Porter?

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.400
Feng Chuanxiang had been missing
for so long.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.590
Is it weird that Shisan Tower is

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.570
interested in him?

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.370
What about us?

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.720
Why would the Porter

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720
choose us as well?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.090
At this point,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.490
I might as well tell you.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.060
What?

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.410
Fiancée?

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.480
I am the handsome and charming Cloud.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.660
Is it weird that a woman likes me?

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.790
Then may I ask who

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.920
your fiancée is?

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.870
Bai Suche.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.570
Bai Suche?

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.920
You mean the one
known as the most beautiful woman

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.920
in Jiangnan, the elegant Bai Suche?

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.370
What's with that look?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:11.989
Nothing.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.060
Your expression clearly says,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.840
"How would that elegant beauty

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.440
marry someone like you?"

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:15.969
Exactly!

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.679
How would she ever agree to marry you?

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.110
A few years ago, I

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.550
went to Jiangnan, performing heroic deeds

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.350
and saving Bai Yuming's family.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.179
He liked me so much

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.909
that he insisted on marrying off
his daughter to me.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.130
What's wrong with this?

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:32.520
Wait.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.969
Are you saying

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.080
that Master Bai

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.820
insisted on betrothing his daughter
to you?

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.520
Instead of me desperately asking

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.449
to marry into their family, right?

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.239
That's not what I meant.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.520
I just think

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.360
that since Master Bai is a descendant
of the Calligraphy Saint,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.110
if you're

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.920
Master Bai's son-in-law,

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.190
you should at least share his interests.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.280
But I'm just

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.679
an underworld gangster.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.429
So what?

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:56.699
Yeah,

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.870
you're right.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.550
You, Cloud, are the hope
of the underworld.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:02.810
Just eat your cake.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.430
The Bai's Estate

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.530
suffered a massacre a year ago, right?

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.280
Indeed, they were massacred.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.150
But no one's found

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.420
my fiancée's body in the estate.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.720
I've always believed

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.770
that she's still alive somewhere.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.050
But

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.330
that doesn't make sense.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.460
After all you've said,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.580
you still haven't explained why

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.540
we'll definitely be chosen by the Porter.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.040
Because I came to look for my fiancée,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.810
who hadn't

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.700
married me yet,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.700
and bought information from Shisan Tower.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.670
Who knew this Shisan Tower

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.800
was all about scams?

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.390
They saw how desperate I was
to find my wife

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.880
and demanded

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.340
a price I couldn't afford.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.630
In the end, I didn't find my wife

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.760
and even got myself sold
to the Shisan Tower.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.150
If that damn Foxy Tang hadn't

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.210
happened to pass by

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.970
with a contract claiming ownership of me,

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.490
saying that I was already sold to him

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.030
and couldn't be sold
to Shisan Tower again.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.370
Between getting sold
to the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.490
or to Foxy Tang,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.920
it was quite obvious

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.380
which one I'd pick, right?

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:05.760
When the Porter sees me

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.690
back here again,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.440
he definitely won't let me go.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.050
Mr. Tang,

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.540
the road ends here.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.710
We've searched everywhere possible.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.710
If we've already searched

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:24.870
all possible places,

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.330
then it must be right here.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:27.930
Shei,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.360
are there really

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:30.590
friends in this world

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.360
you can trust with your life?

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.090
You go to Yanmen
with the messenger goose first.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.860
I will

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.790
go there for a thorough investigation.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480
Mr. Tang!

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.110
[Floating Red Worm Silk]

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.450
Please feel free to take a look.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.520
It's just one year of your lifespan.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.120
What are you hesitating for?

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.450
The porter carries weight on both ends.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.280
One end succeeds, one end fails.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.050
Welcome, everyone, to Buhuan Tower.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.970
May I ask which guest

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.600
will make the first bid?

00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.710
Me.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.550
What is your offer?

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:16.730
A pair of sorrowful eyes.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.670
Three fingers filled with hatred.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.720
Five drops of blood from my heart.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.120
Ten years of freedom.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.850
What are you trying to exchange for?

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.750
The real culprit.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:31.590
Carrying pole,

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:33.210
what do you think?

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:50.600
Sir.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.580
Your chips aren't enough, I'm afraid.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:54.460
Unless...

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.030
Unless what?

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.520
Unless you exchange your life for it!

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.010
Mr. Jiang, what are you doing?

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.790
I'm trying to kill you.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:53.440
You're the one

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.100
bringing it upon yourself.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.850
According to my plan,

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.090
after Cheng died
and the murderer confessed,

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.800
my brother's furious actions

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.660
would offend
the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.000
And then I would rightfully

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.490
become the master of the Yanmen Sect.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.230
This wonderful

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.960
dream-come-true moment

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.250
was ruined

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.810
by your sudden appearance.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.790
I paid a hefty price

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.360
to Shisan Tower's Master

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.960
for a chance to kill you.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.110
Here and now,

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.510
no one will

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.800
step in and help you.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.970
Today,

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.770
you're doomed to die.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.240
Mr. Tang,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.650
I want to find Chuanxiang

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.480
and ask him

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.690
why he wanted to kill me.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.920
We used to be best friends
who would die for each other.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.720
Why are we turning on each other?

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.960
If someone kills people because of me,

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:09.110
if innocents suffer because of me,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.280
does that make it my karma?

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.450
Tang Lici, do you see now?

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.550
Such a tiny pill

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.480
can turn the best friends

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:33.640
into bitter enemies

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.440
and make family members
betray and kill each other.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.480
Who can resist the temptation

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.960
of overnight wealth, glory,

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.880
and unparalleled martial arts?

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.030
I have already spread it

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.800
throughout the martial arts world.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.280
It has returned to this world

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.550
all because of you,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.070
Tang Lici.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:49.960
This time,

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.620
I'll make you wish you were dead.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.110
Let your friends be your warning.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.170
It's their fault
for trusting the wrong person.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.730
You

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.070
can't save them.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.670
Liu Yan's curse bug?

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.980
I can't save them?

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.820
But Liu Yan,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.810
I'm looking for you.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.750
Yanmen.
