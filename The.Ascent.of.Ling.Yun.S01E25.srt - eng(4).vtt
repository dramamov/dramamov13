=Episode 25=

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.840
(So His Majesty Favors That Type)

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.744
Your Ladyship,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200
since returning
from Noble Lady Mu's place,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.120
why have you been so dejected?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.632
Sister,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.520
will you play the horse tamer today

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.520
or

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.200
the wild steed to be tamed?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.120
So His Majesty

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.640
favors that type.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.160
Your Ladyship,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.760
what does His Majesty favor?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.120
It's nothing.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.000
Your Ladyship,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.080
I think His Majesty still
cares deeply for you.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
You'll defeat Noble Lady Mu

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.240
and regain His Majesty's favor.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.280
I've never considered her my rival.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.000
My greatest concern now

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.560
is Lord Wu's safety alone.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.800
I try to regain favor,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.440
so he could be free

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480
from Consort Jing's manipulation.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.000
To counterbalance Consort Jing,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.680
I must regain His Majesty's affection.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.456
Noble Lady Mu,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.560
how dutiful you are
to pay daily respects to me.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.680
It's merely my humble duty.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.440
Your Highness,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.800
there's something puzzling me.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.160
Please make it clear to me.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.968
Speak.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.200
Though His Majesty favors me,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.800
I feel

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.960
in His Majesty's heart,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160
another person lingers.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.160
Do you know who this one is?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560
You're inquiring

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.280
whether His Majesty

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.560
still cares for Concubine Yun, right?

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.120
To pour new water into a cup,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.320
one needn't empty existing water first.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.880
I care not what fills the cup.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.280
If it displeases my palate,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.800
it shall be discarded.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.776
(Imperial Study)

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:16.576
(Imperial Study)

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.800
May endless fortune bless you.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.080
Rise, Noble Lady Mu.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.040
This is the first time I've seen you
visiting the Imperial Study voluntarily.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.120
With His Majesty occupied
by state affairs,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.840
I came to check on him.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.520
You're overthinking.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.160
His Majesty enjoys my nightly company.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.760
I'll surely attend to him diligently

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.320
to shoulder your burdens.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.880
As imperial consorts,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.680
we should serve His Majesty diligently.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520
Noble Lady Mu,
you cannot take our place.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.080
I shall take my leave.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.120
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
- Your Highness.
- Please forgive me.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.400
You careless servant!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.880
You've soiled Her Ladyship's robe,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.960
preventing her from seeing His Majesty.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320
It's fine.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.440
Thank Her Ladyship for her generosity

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.080
for sparing you worthless servant.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.640
Thank you for your mercy.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.960
Noble Lady Mu,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.720
let me make this clear.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.720
I don't intend to vie for favor,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.560
nor should you consider me your enemy.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.112
Your Highness,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.360
I entered the palace
bearing my clan's hopes.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.040
Your lack of ambition

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.480
doesn't negate my need to challenge you.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.800
Even so,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.240
in imperial harem of endless schemes,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.240
how many people secure lasting favor?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.120
In the end,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.520
it's nothing but an illusion.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.120
You're wrong.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.800
How could His Majesty's favor

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.280
be a mere illusion?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.960
Whom His Majesty cherishes

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.760
blooms like vibrant flowers.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.560
So I must remove

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.200
all obstacles in my path to honor

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.760
one by one.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.040
Securing His Majesty's only devotion

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.240
shall spare me

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.160
from empty illusions.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.480
How dare you!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.560
It's fine

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.760
to think about that,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.032
but you mustn't say it.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.640
Imperial harem rivalries

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.440
serve different purposes.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.720
I once schemed for favor too,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520
but only to lose what I cherished most.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.960
Here's my advice for you.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040
Abandon your relentless obsession.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.208
Now, I only seek

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.840
to atone for my wrongdoings in the past.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.960
I don't intend to vie for favor.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.280
I know what you mean.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.560
If what you just said is true,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.280
I shall

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.120
live in peace with you.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.240
Oh my.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.560
Chief Wu

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.720
has truly been determined

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.160
to become someone's lapdog.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.080
Sir,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.680
have you caught wind of something?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.560
Having served in the palace for decades,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.120
nothing escapes my eyes.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.960
What exactly are you implying?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.960
Share some gossip to liven us up.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.680
Then consider this mere storytelling.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.960
Don't take it seriously.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
Rest assured.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.120
Our lips are sealed.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.360
Have you heard

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.184
Concubine Shu has conceived
the imperial heir?

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:18.112
Yes.

00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:19.072
We've heard.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.880
But someone

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.560
smuggled abortifacient into the palace.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960
Huh?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.120
Another disaster looms.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.880
Last time, Tong An got betrayed

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.160
and died horribly.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.800
Now I wonder which poor soul

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.480
will pay with his life this time.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.776
Sir,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.928
are you suggesting

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.160
Chief Wu plans to eliminate
Concubine Shu's heir

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.760
and find a scapegoat?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.800
Hey, you fool.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.672
I never said that!

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.200
Such talk could have me killed.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.224
Let's go!

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.200
(Fourteen Bureaus)

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.800
Your Highness, why are you here?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.200
I came to tell you

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.320
stop aiding Consort Jing in her schemes.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.520
Countless eyes are watching you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.400
Secrets can't stay hidden forever.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.560
You'll be in trouble if it goes on.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.080
What are you implying?

00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:07.560
I don't understand.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.200
- Bi Da!
- I am Wu Linfu.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.472
Fine.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.040
Since you claim to be a servant,
let me ask you.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.200
Why did you bring abortifacient in here?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.632
Also,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.960
how did Tong An die?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.760
This is musk powder.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.240
Why have you become this?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.560
Is it because of me?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.800
I'm asking you.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.880
I have chosen this path.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.672
I'll walk it alone.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.480
Spare no concern for me.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.800
I was wrong.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.728
Don't be like this.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.944
Please?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.440
You overestimate me.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.256
Bi Da,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.336
I was wrong.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.560
I don't want it.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.640
I want nothing more.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.560
Just become the one
you used to be, okay?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.840
Listen to me.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.480
If any imperial consort loses her child

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.200
because of you,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.600
the blood on your hands

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.640
will stain eternally.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.272
So what?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.440
It is

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.120
none of your business.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.496
And...

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.840
Never come again.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.424
You're unwelcome here.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.440
Why must you be like this?

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.560
You should leave now.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.480
Commendable acting, Lord Wu.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.440
Though consumed by affection,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.440
you feign this heartless facade.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.960
It almost

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.800
fooled me.

00:09:16.884 --> 00:09:18.912
(Yongxiu Palace)

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.040
Any orders, Your Highness?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.920
Bribe someone

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.480
we can trust in Concubine Shu's palace.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.000
Replace her usual incense

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.424
with this.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.824
Your Highness.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
Currently,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.320
Concubine Shu is pregnant.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.200
If anything goes wrong,

00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:51.640
we

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.840
can't afford the blame.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.160
Don't worry.
I'll take responsibility for everything.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080
You won't be implicated.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.928
Please rest assured.

00:10:04.928 --> 00:10:05.920
I

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.240
will surely fulfill your orders.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.784
Your Highness.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.416
Your Highness?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.760
Your Highness?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.040
How audacious!

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.840
How dare you tamper
with Concubine Shu's censer?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.800
I've treated you well.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.320
Why did you poison my censer?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.040
Your Highness, I was wrong.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.840
It was Yongxiu Palace's Eunuch Jian.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.200
He ordered me to replace the incense
in your censer.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.960
Yongxiu Palace?

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.520
So Concubine Yun truly intended
to harm Concubine Shu.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.680
I shall meet His Majesty at once.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.040
May endless fortune bless you.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.960
Concubine Yun,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.400
Concubine Shu's maid
was caught red-handed with poison.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.560
She confessed being ordered by you
to harm the imperial heir.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.960
How do you explain?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.920
Concubine Yun has come
to confront you directly.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.440
Explain yourself clearly!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.800
Eunuch Jian, please prove my innocence.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.240
Even with a thousand lives,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.960
I'd never dare harm the imperial heir.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.640
I was ordered by Eunuch Jian!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.440
Your Majesty, please spare me!

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.320
I

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.840
was also ordered

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.120
to arrange the maid

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.240
to replace the incense
in Concubine Shu's censer.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.280
Who gave you the order?
