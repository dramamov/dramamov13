00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:08.960
Mr. Xingchen has no experience
in managing the company.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.977
Everyone isn't convinced about him
parachuting in.

00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:12.600
Mr. Mo, you're here.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:13.439
You've been working hard lately.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.929
This way, please.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.422
Alright.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.670
Good morning.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.600
Everyone's here.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.160
Mr. Xingchen,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.750
talk about perfect timing.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.600
I heard you're planning reforms.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
The company has always run on
a traditional model.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.600
You want a reform as soon as you come.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.720
If something goes wrong,
who will take responsibility?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.240
I will.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.440
Mr. Xingchen,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.390
you've just taken over.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.160
You may not know the full situation yet.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.520
Why don't you reconsider it?

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:55.550
I understand

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.440
your concerns.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.310
But times are changing.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.160
If the company doesn't change,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.080
we'll soon be eliminated by the market.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.190
Creating a diverse range
of consumer experiences

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.880
is the top priority now.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360
As if we don't know about it.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.960
Guys,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.200
do you think
he knows business management?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.640
This is too risky.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.360
Everyone,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
I actually think
Mr. Xingchen's plan is workable.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.960
He brings fresh ideas and perspective.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.960
The company

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.110
mustn't remain unchanged out of fear.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.670
I believe
this is what the company needs.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.360
Mr. Mo,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.080
weren't you always against
sudden reforms?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.200
I have faith in Mr. Xingchen's
vision and ability.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.110
- If so, we can only follow.
- Fine.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.800
No choice. Yeah.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.360
Alright, then.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520
How about this?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.200
You may head to the meeting room first.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.022
I'll talk to Mr. Xingchen.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.240
Alright, let's go.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.550
Finish the current project first.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.110
Even though we're love rivals,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.590
thanks for what you said just now.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960
Since you're back at Xinghan,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960
as the executive secretary,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.870
I will fully support you.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.870
But I have one question.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.590
Go ahead.

00:03:22.044 --> 00:03:24.110
Haven't you always refused to
come back to Xinghan?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.830
I think

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.990
someone wants me to come back.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.960
Mr. Lu?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760
Gu Liusu.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.020
(Xinghan Group)

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.040
(This time,
the focus isn't on the design,)

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.430
(but on materials.)

00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:04.830
(Lu: Scan the QR code for a surprise.)
(Recyclable and biodegradable.)

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.760
(Low-carbon production.)

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.480
(These are all certified eco-friendly.)

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:08.710
(Marine grade aluminum)

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.488
(is refined from
discarded fishing boats)

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:12.960
(and ocean waste.)

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.920
(Sea glass)

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.550
(is polished by the tides)

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.390
(into fragments with gem texture.)

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.000
(By combining them,)

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.640
(that's my "Tears of the Deep Sea".)

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.710
Do you think Xingchen inherited
my business sense?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.440
He reformed the mall's operation model.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.790
It attracted a ton of young visitors.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.030
This kid has got some skill.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.080
Ever since you two made peace,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.200
I've noticed you're much happier.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.150
You're always talking about him.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.150
If this were a short drama,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.270
shouldn't I be fighting him
over money or something?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.640
What?

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.560
I don't give you enough money to spend?

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.880
I'm sure Xingchen is capable enough

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.200
to make what he wants.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.560
Let him make money himself.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.350
Oh, right.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.710
Is he having a fight with Liusu again?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.350
My bestie has been
busy with work lately.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.030
But your son's being too childish.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.390
I don't know how to talk to him.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.710
I just hope they can talk it out.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.030
Help me say something nice to Liusu.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.710
Alright.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.270
I helped your son deliver
a necklace over yesterday.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.680
Alright.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.590
I'm heading to work.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.200
Sure.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.640
Wait.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960
Your glasses.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.080
The young one is Mr. Lu Junior,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.640
and the old one is Mr. Lu Senior.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.230
You're always so thoughtful, Dear.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.440
Alright, I'm off.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.680
Come back early.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.640
I'll wait for you.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.230
Sure.

00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:43.460
(According to our station's sources,)

00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:44.790
(since 2000, Xinghan Group has embarked)

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.133
(on its second large-scale construction
of commercial buildings.)

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.420
(However, there are suspicions
of illegal forced demolitions)

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:51.420
(during this construction.)

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.340
(It's said someone has been hurt.)

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.900
(Evil company!)

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.380
- Give us back our homes!
- Give us back our homes!

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.580
(We'll keep following up on this story.)

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.590
Mr. Lu.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.270
Go prepare tea first.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.560
What's happened?

00:06:08.711 --> 00:06:10.644
There was an incident
at the construction site.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.830
A resident

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.270
refused to move out.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.320
The foreman tried to force demolition
to meet the deadline,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.590
and someone got hurt.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.880
How could this happen?

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.080
I've always stressed safety first

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.150
on-site.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.790
Look what you've done.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.880
The problem now

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.390
is that the worker's family
won't let this go easily.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.230
What matters most right now

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.120
is to calm them down.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.320
Where's the family?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.760
At the hospital.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.710
Come with me to the site.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.270
We need to keep the crowd under control.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.150
Does Xingchen know?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.440
I haven't had time to tell him yet.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.030
Don't tell him.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.120
Understood.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.270
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.760
We'll handle it.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.640
If this isn't dealt with properly,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.270
it'll hurt the company's reputation.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.000
What I fear most is
that it'll affect Xingchen.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.080
You really love Mr. Xingchen.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.960
He's my only son.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.320
Who else

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.640
would I love?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.560
We're almost there.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.960
I'll go take a look first.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.080
Please wait

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.960
in the car.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.030
Alright.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.080
Mr. Lu.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.200
What's happened?

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.960
Mr. Lu,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.710
do you remember today?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.800
Your dad is Lu Jianhua.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.750
I'll take you to see him, okay?

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.960
He's not our family, after all.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.320
How could I hand over my life's work

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.440
to an outsider?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.710
I asked you to look after my son.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.750
Is this how you do it?

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.750
I'm sorry.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.990
You said you'd look after Gu Liusu.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.644
Is this what you call
taking care of her?

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.040
(Isn't this Gu Nian?)

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.750
Gu Nian is Liusu.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.590
Liusu is my girlfriend now.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.750
I'm not giving you any more chances.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.400
If we go out on a date day,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.600
he might get the wrong idea.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.440
Your DNA doesn't match.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.044
So you're not his biological father.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.920
Mom!

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:23.020
(Grain Buds. Death Anniversary of Mom)

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.630
(Mom,)

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.350
(you said Lu Jianhua is my dad.)

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.160
(But he doesn't acknowledge me.)

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.360
(Tang Baozhu)
(All he knows is to have me)

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.200
(Fiancée of Xinghan Group's Lu Jianhu)
(clean up after his useless son.)

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.393
(Lu Jianhua: From Zero to One,)
(He's never once)

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.955
(Back to Zero)
(taken me seriously.)

00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:09.660
(Gu Liusu, GL's CEO)

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.710
(I wanted him to stay with me
a little longer.)

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.680
(Forget it. I'll let him
be with you instead.)
