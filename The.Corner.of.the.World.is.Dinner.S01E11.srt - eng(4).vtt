00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Longan, Poria, and Chinese yam

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.639
Goji berries

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.199
Hui, you called me?

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.280
The coffee shop owner told me

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.080
Zhen Gui showed up

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.360
I'm waiting for her at the entrance

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.960
Come quickly

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.479
Okay

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.560
Send me your location

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.199
Okay

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.919
You take the front, I'll take the back

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.000
We can't let her get away

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.120
There's no back door

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.560
Go, go, go

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:12.839
I really didn't expect it

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.839
I always see her lounging around

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.360
Doodling on the sofa

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.639
I thought she was just scribbling

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.720
Turns out

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.480
Her drawings are actually pretty good

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:27.639
What?

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.800
Doesn't Zhen Gui always say

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.160
she can't find her direction

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.759
All these years

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.560
she's never finished anything?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.360
So, think about it

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.040
Why don't we help her publish this art book?

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.639
We both like it

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.639
Others will surely appreciate her art too

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.480
I happen to know a famous editor

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.000
But

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.920
Editor Chi is right here

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:08.759
This is the place you mentioned

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.959
The private kitchen that's supposed to be amazing

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:10.879
Yes, this is it

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.480
Isn't this just a regular apartment building?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.279
Yeah

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.279
I'm leaving

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.120
I swear, I'm not lying

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.480
I'm not going

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480
Why would I lie to you?

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.600
Hello, Editor Chi

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.639
We've been waiting for you

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.360
Editor Chi, this is...

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:29.439
Smells so good

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.480
Isn't it cute?

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.480
It's pretty cute

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.319
Editor Chi, please wait a moment

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.120
There's more

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.040
No rush, no rush

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.639
No rush, no rush

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.480
It's fine, it's fine

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.759
What a feast

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.839
What's this?

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.040
Let me introduce the dishes

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.560
Basque-style stewed chicken

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.920
Rosemary prawns

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.480
Teriyaki salmon

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.480
Are all the dishes ready?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.800
Please, help yourself

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:24.639
Delicious

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.040
Try some fish

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.279
This fish is so tender

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.600
Have a prawn

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.319
Delicious

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.000
So tasty

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.320
Editor Chi

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.000
This private kitchen meal

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.320
How do you like the taste?

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.200
Delicious

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.559
It's unbelievably good

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.240
It soothes me from the inside out

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.080
And what about Zhen Gui's picture book?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.080
It comforts the soul

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:21.000
So publishing it shouldn't be a problem, right?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.240
Our publishing house

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.960
is planning an event

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:28.559
with the theme "Discovering the Good and Beauty in Life"

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.960
This picture book

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.919
fits our selection criteria perfectly

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:34.840
But

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240
You'll need to provide a 20,000 yuan

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.360
initial startup fee

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.279
Okay

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.960
It's really good

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080
Ma Yong Yong

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.840
I really like his work

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.639
So, what about Zhen Gui's picture book?

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:23.960
By the way

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.000
Can you get Ma Yong Yong's autograph for me?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.960
Zhen Gui's book is pretty good

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960
Let's talk about it later

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.360
Sis

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.519
How much is this book?

00:10:58.799 --> 00:10:59.600
Eighteen

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.320
Wait a moment

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.480
I'll go find my mom

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:22.879
Baby

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.879
The flowers at home have bloomed

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:25.799
They smell wonderful

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.679
Smell them

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.039
This

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.480
is from the mother of that autistic child

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.519
She wrote it to me

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.039
She said she's very grateful to me

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.240
Because of my drawings

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.879
her child

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.120
started to love the beauty of this world

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:28.039
She said she's tried for six years

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:30.039
and was about to give up

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.919
But because of me

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.559
she's found hope again

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.039
Before, I

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:45.679
often said I just wanted to take it easy.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.519
I wanted to slack off.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.639
But deep down, I couldn't accept it.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.519
Because I couldn't find a way out.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.039
But the truth is,

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.240
we can't just lie down and give up.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.639
If you do that,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.240
you miss out on so many chances.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.120
I don't want to waste my youth.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.519
Thank you all.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.080
It's all thanks to Nian'er.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:16.240
Her cooking impressed Editor Chi.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.000
And Hui,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.720
she took a risk and brought Editor Chi home.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.279
But Zhen Gui,

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.480
how did you get

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.919
the reader's letter and this picture book?

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.240
We both couldn't reach you.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.960
Did the publisher finally call you?

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:28.480
No.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.679
This manuscript—

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:32.240
I lost it a long time ago.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.360
I thought I'd misplaced it.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.320
But that day, while browsing a bookstore,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.120
I accidentally saw this picture book.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.159
I thought I'd hit the jackpot.

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:43.000
Someone found my manuscript,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.720
and even published it.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.360
So I rushed to the publisher.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:48.879
And then—

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:51.440
I really did get lucky.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:54.240
You two are my lucky stars.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.480
You love me.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.480
Of course we love you.

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:00.759
I love you both too.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.440
Since you love us,

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.240
next time, don't

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.679
disappear without a word.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.639
Don't run away from problems.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.440
Talk to us.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.840
We'll help you figure it out.

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:14.879
I'm sorry.

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.720
I won't avoid things anymore.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.279
But—

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:21.360
I've made up my mind.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.960
I want to go back home

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.240
and stay for a while.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.039
No matter what happens,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.360
I want to give it a try.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.000
I want to see if I can

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.559
save my parents' relationship.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.320
You're leaving too?

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.080
Me too.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.480
Take two.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:12.679
Sorry, sorry.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.279
Be careful.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.480
You bumped my leg.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.879
You walk inside.

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:19.320
I'll check over there.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:31.720
Two pieces.

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.480
These are all on sale.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:40.519
These two are expensive.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:42.120
I'll look for regular ones.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.879
I picked these out specially.

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:44.960
I want this one.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.919
We're going over budget today.

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:48.240
It's my treat tonight.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.399
I'm making you all

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.720
an unforgettable meal.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.639
Now I don't want to leave even more.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.360
What should I do?

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.120
Then my plan worked.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.600
Tonight's dinner

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.080
is about saying goodbye,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.200
and new beginnings.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.039
I'll use the freshest ingredients of the season

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:26.879
to make them a truly special dish.

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:31.080
Countless spring bamboo shoots fill the forest,
(An ancient Chinese poem about the bamboo shoot season)

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.200
hidden from passersby.
(An ancient Chinese poem about the bamboo shoot season)

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.600
This season,

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.360
nothing is fresher than bamboo shoots.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.679
After Grain Rain,

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.600
you'll have to wait until next year.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.480
I want to pour all my best wishes

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.360
into this rich Yan Du Xian.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.680
While it simmers,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.640
I'll make Tang Bu Shuai,
(a sweet glutinous rice dessert from Guangdong, symbolizing sweetness and togetherness)

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.680
Sweetness and togetherness, a happiness that sticks with us.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.799
Sweetness and togetherness, a happiness that sticks with us.

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:05.480
The soup is thick now.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.240
Time to add the bamboo shoots.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.400
Scoop out the rice balls, cool them in water.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.799
Brown sugar, warm water.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.960
Melt it over low heat.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.400
Pour in the cooked rice balls.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.880
Simmer on low heat.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.920
Keep stirring so it doesn't burn.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.599
Coat them in thick caramel sauce.

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:28.640
Finally, sprinkle with sesame and dried osmanthus.

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:40.240
Prepare Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.039
Zhen Gui can't live without spice.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.559
She kept complaining

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.680
she hasn't had anything spicy in days.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.799
The secret to Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:53.279
is garlic and chili peppers.

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.599
And doubanjiang.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.960
Let me introduce

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.920
a special dessert from Guangdong—

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.759
Tang Bu Shuai,
(a sweet glutinous rice dessert from Guangdong, symbolizing sweetness and togetherness)

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.359
Changsha-style Spicy Mapo Tofu.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.160
Nian'er's version of Yan Du Xian.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.039
Try it now!

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:03.519
This is my culinary masterpiece.

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:11.680
Start with the soup.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.480
Why not have something sweet?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.480
Eat more.

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:36.119
This meal is truly unforgettable.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.680
Thank you.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.680
May our future be just as wonderful.

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:51.480
Wishing us a beautiful future.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:53.880
Wishing us a beautiful future.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.039
No one else can rent my room.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.240
I want that too.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.680
This is my royalty payment.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.680
You have to accept it.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.599
I want to help you fulfill your wish.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.400
Take Grandma back to Xinjiang.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.240
Thank you.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:47.880
Hui.

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:49.799
I drew this.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.440
This is how I imagine

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.480
your baby will look.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.680
Doesn't it look like you as a child?

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.200
So cute.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.680
Okay.

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:07.599
I'll accept it for the baby.

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:08.359
But—

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.720
I haven't prepared gifts for you yet.

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:13.039
I don't have a gift either.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920
This picture book,

00:28:17.599 --> 00:28:20.240
and last night's dinner,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.440
are the best gifts you've given me.

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:42.200
When will we meet again?

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.000
I don't know.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.839
But I do know—

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:50.200
our future will be beautiful.
