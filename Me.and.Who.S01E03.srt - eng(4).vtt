Milady,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.920
I'm not a shipper,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040
but these two...

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.900
are totally a thing!

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.120
What I witnessed was so romantic!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040
If they're not a couple,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.560

Milady?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.400
Ooh, she wasn't speechless;

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.120
she just hung up.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.360
I think this is enough.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.800
I read Francois' mind earlier;

that our love was real.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.000
You don't have to be so tense now.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.440
What?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.280
Tense?

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.800
Me? Tense?

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.920
That performance of mine was smooth.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.660
It's totally
nothing out of the ordinary!

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440
Oh...

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.560
You read my mind, didn't you?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.200
Having that ability
must be really nice.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.380
I'm jelly.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.000
That way, you understand
what people think.

I wish I could read minds, too.

A famous influencer
[Housekeeper Invades Influencer's Room]

shared a scandalous clip
[#BanningSiaoTawanGroup]

showing a housekeeper entering her room

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200
without permission!

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:32.833
This has netizens
questioning the security

of the 5-star hotel!

00:05:37.502 --> 00:05:43.902
Right now, #BanningSiaoTawanGroup
is trending at No. 1 on Y platform,

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:47.827
causing the company's share price
to fall by 10%.

Hang in there, Ya.

00:06:09.423 --> 00:06:10.743
See you this evening.

00:06:12.783 --> 00:06:13.423
Alright,

00:06:13.463 --> 00:06:14.343
thank you.

00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:40.223
Of course.

00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:42.623
- Canceling? What would you...
- If there's any further update,

00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:44.343
- I will keep you informed.
- The board members...

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:46.222
The board members
are now in the meeting.

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:48.103
- Certainly.
- If there are any more updates,

00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:49.783
- Yes, sir.
- I will immediately contact you back.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.703
My deepest apologies.

00:07:02.163 --> 00:07:03.783
Regarding the incident,

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:06.583
the Internet users
have been writing us horrible reviews,

00:07:06.623 --> 00:07:07.703
causing our rating to plummet.

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.583
Plus, the company's stock
has been falling steadily.

00:07:11.143 --> 00:07:13.023
The board members have discussed

00:07:14.043 --> 00:07:15.503
that we should fire this housekeeper

00:07:16.283 --> 00:07:17.863
as a way to take accountability!

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:23.983
Was it you on the news?

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:28.583
Who's the head housekeeper?

00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:36.223
Can I have a talk
with both of you privately?

00:07:36.903 --> 00:07:37.703
Sure.

00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:39.103
Come on.

00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:44.703
Can any of you tell me

00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:47.103
what exactly happened
on that particular day?

00:07:48.623 --> 00:07:50.223
It's my fault.

00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:52.943
I thought the guest
had already checked out,

00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:55.223
so I told Bee to clean the room.

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.743
Mr. Suriya, please don't fire her.

00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:01.043
Then, should I fire you?

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.383
How are you gonna take responsibility?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.103
Look me in the eye,

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:09.743
and answer me.

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.263
- There's a message from HR.
- Oh!

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.223
Wait, Ms. Nid was fired?

00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:27.103
- What?!
- Seriously?

00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:28.023
Why so?

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.503
- Ooh...
- Let me talk to Auntie Nid.

00:08:32.543 --> 00:08:33.583
Let's go!

00:08:38.103 --> 00:08:39.703
Poor her,

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:41.263
taking the fall for her subordinate.

00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:42.983
She looks really sad.

00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:46.823
Look...

00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:49.423
Please go back to work.

00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:54.543
- Right?
- Yeah!

00:08:56.863 --> 00:08:57.783
Oh, here he comes!

00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:03.543
Oops.

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:11.763
Goodness, look at you
being so protective of her.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.890
Seriously, is she your kept woman?

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.136
What did Auntie Nid ever do to you?

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.950
At least be as good at managing
as you are at firing people.

after the incident at the hotel,

00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:41.983
there seems to be
tension between the two.

00:10:43.623 --> 00:10:44.503
It looks like...

the vow is gonna be broken
even before it's written.

00:10:52.316 --> 00:10:53.316
Well...

- I think Mr. Suriya...
- Shh!

00:11:33.263 --> 00:11:35.503
is very generous!

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:38.143
It was that Auntie Nid
who put on an angelic facade

00:11:38.183 --> 00:11:40.183
with all that goody-goody act!

saw through all that facade;

otherwise, Bee would've been
the one having no job.

Speaking of which,
I kinda feel bad for her.

what people are thinking about you.

I can't control anyone's thoughts.

So you just let people think

00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:57.511
the housekeeper is your kept woman?

00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.719
Are you worried about me,

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:01.719
or are you jealous?

Ooh! I thought my ship was wrecked!

Uh...

Right, it was nothing, Milady.

Right, I am spying on them, Milady!

Yes, Milady. Just a sec!

I doubt anyone wants to swim.

some of the guests
canceled their reservations.

Wait!

00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:02.085
No one would say anything.

If anyone sees us,
it's gonna create a bigger problem.

00:15:28.005 --> 00:15:28.805
Fine.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.399
Hey...

00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:36.287
Join me.

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:38.678
Don't even think.

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:40.439
Satisfied?

00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:42.359
Now, get out of the pool.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.759
If you don't get up, I'll be leaving.

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:52.519
Hey, wait!

00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:08.536
Heh, game over.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.567
Hey!

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.159
There!

00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:19.109
Whoa...

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:22.159
You're so done!

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:30.679
Come here!

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:32.839
Come over here!

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:46.839
Miss,

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.039
the pool is currently closed.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.799
It is. It really is!

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.559
You have a booking?
Let me make you a new one.

00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:52.999
Please excuse me.

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:13.239
I'm sorry

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.639
for saying
I was jealous of your ability.

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.019
I realize now

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.079
how unenjoyable it is.

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.119
It weighs me down,

00:17:29.159 --> 00:17:30.759
just hearing a few people gossiping.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:33.719
But you...

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:37.319
have heard this all your life.

00:17:39.439 --> 00:17:40.559
You're a freaking boss!

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:47.319
To tell you the truth,

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.279
I don't want to be as tough as you see,

00:17:52.159 --> 00:17:53.439
but if I were ever fragile,

00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:57.699
how could Father trust me
with our family's business?

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:11.099
All this time,

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:13.224
His Excellency must feel very lonesome.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:16.359
If someone gave him a comforting hug,

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:17.504
that would be nice.

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:31.399
Did you just read my mind again?

00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:34.199
In all honesty,

00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:36.551
being able to read minds
is not all that bad.

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:39.239
At least,

00:18:40.318 --> 00:18:42.198
it also makes me more empathetic

00:18:43.239 --> 00:18:44.439
and less quick to judge.

00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:49.599
Are you calling me out?

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.079
You're peculiar, you know?

00:18:54.659 --> 00:18:57.479
Normally, I only meet
people who think one thing

00:18:57.739 --> 00:18:58.959
but do the opposite.

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:00.559
But for you,

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:02.319
you truly...

00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:03.599
speak your mind.

00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:04.323
Huh?

00:19:05.572 --> 00:19:06.772
Are you roasting me again?

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:08.279
You're saying I have no filter?

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:13.399
I'm saying that...

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:14.559
you're a genuine one.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.280
What's your plan now?

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.680
I might not be a master of business,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.520
but when it comes to providing service,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.320
I'm second to none.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.560
Straining your eyes too much

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.760
can give you headaches.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.400
Therefore, I, Phopthorn,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.120
will be at your service, Mr. Suriya.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.920
Give me your head.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.240
So,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.120
you have done this for someone before?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.760
More than I could count.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.880
Huh?!

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.400
Well,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.990
I worked part-time jobs.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.920
Don't tell me

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.080
that you were also
a hotel staff member?

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.440
Of course!

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.280
Wait,

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.600
seriously?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.000
I was only joking.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.780
Well, it's true.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.540
In the other world,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.120
I did everything
that puts food on the table.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.480
You must have really struggled
over there.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
Extremely.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.200
Working as a laborer,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.640
I was treated like a servant every day.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.120
I worked my butt off,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.640
but the people who took all the credit

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.160
were my bosses.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.760
The ones like Auntie Nid?

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.280
That's so darn right.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.720
It's like a stab in the heart.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.440
Not many people
consider those at the bottom,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.640
even though...

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.080
they do everything
to fulfill their duty.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.240
All done.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740
Thank you very much.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.840
Uh...

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.880
You can take the bed tonight.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.840
It's fine.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.200
I'm used to the floor now.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.400
Sweet dreams.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200
Good night.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.640
Oh...

00:24:07.733 --> 00:24:09.733
His Excellency
has left for work since early morning.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:10.840
Uh...

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.970
Since early morning?

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.690
It seems he's dealing
with some serious business.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.360
Young Master,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.760
please enjoy your breakfast.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.200
Right this way.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.200
Prior to this, the renowned hotel
dismissed its head housekeeper

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.940
following an exposé
by a famous influencer.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.110
Today, M.R. Suriya Suriyadechakorn,
[M.R. Suriya Issues Special Statement]

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.690
representing the board of directors
at Siao Tawan Group,

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.550
has come forward
with a special statement.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.840
It is with my sincere apologies
for the incident.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.030
I hereby announce our willingness

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.250
to re-evaluate
the hotel's screening policy

00:25:16.133 --> 00:25:17.933
to achieve
the greatest benefits for our guests

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.400
and our employees in the future.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.840
Does it mean that the hotel admits

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.680
to personnel issues?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.160
Does it?

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.160
- Is it true?
- Is it?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.480
Are there really any issues?

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:32.870
We see shortcomings in this matter.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.340
[M.R. Suriya Issues Special Statement]

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.760
There are also issues
regarding employee well-being,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.720
resulting in subordinates

00:25:39.027 --> 00:25:40.527
being exploited by their supervisors.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.760
Apart from apologizing
to all of the guests,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.240
I would like to apologize
to all the staff members

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.630
for not appreciating their value.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.370
From now on,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.710
I will implement measures
to ensure staff are better treated,

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.750
along with developing
a healthier workplace environment.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.480
Most importantly,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.180
I will secure more investigations

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.810
to make sure
no employees are taken advantage of.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.480
That sounds great.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.280
After realizing
how the hotel takes action,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.480
how do you feel?

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.840
I wasn't going
to take this further to begin with.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.240
My intention in posting
was just to warn people.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.800
Has the hotel
compensated you in any way?

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.800
Loads!

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.280
There were discounts,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.200
not to mention Mr. Suriya
personally calling me to apologize.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.130
I am very satisfied.
[The Influencer Opens Up]

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.080
Thank you for today.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.720
- Of course, thank you.
- Thank you.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.200
Shouldn't you see him in person?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.040
After everything,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.280
I'm sure he would love
to hear your encouragement directly.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360
Yes, Milady?!

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.760
Right, the signal
is pretty bad, Milady.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.640
I'll contact you back, Milady!

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.440
Yes, Milady!

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.960
Whoa,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I'm down bad for this?

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.580
This is a wise approach
to resolve the situation, M.R. Suriya.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.600
Right now, our company's stock
is back to green.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.380
Honestly speaking,

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.910
the board members
have become more confident in you.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.930
I heard people saying

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.850
that M.C. Jakkawarn must be relieved

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.230
in passing over
Siao Tawan Group to your care.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.640
I appreciate your compliments,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.590
but there's still a lot to learn.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.400
I guess...

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.740
there's a certain someone
giving you support.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.160
Judging by your smile,

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.680
is it safe to say that there is?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.920
Congrats, Your Excellency.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.810
You did a great job.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.120
This has to be the receipt

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.600
proving to Milady
that they're in love!

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.640
Um...

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.080
Your Excellency,
did you hear something?

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.160
Cheers to M.R. Ya

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.040
for successfully settling the issue.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.880
Cheers.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.960
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.980
Right.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.850
- Thank you.
- Ya is goated!

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.200
Thank you, everyone,

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.840
but I will also
have to give credit to Apo.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.120
The reason
I could come up with solutions

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.560
is because of him.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.230
Thank you, Apo.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.520
Also,

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.200
please pass my gratitude
to Butler Francois

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.240
for taking good care of us both.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.400
And, Mother,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.120
thank you so much
for sending him to us.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.240
Though, after this,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.240
I'd like to ask
for my privacy with Apo.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.640
- But I...
- It's settled, then.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.240
You shouldn't have sent in
the butler in the first place.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.640
He was merely
a third wheel to the couple.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.840
I was worried about them, darling.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.280
I just wanted to know
how they were holding up on their own

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.680
and if they knew what they were doing,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.600
so I sent the butler to help.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:50.920
Uh...

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440
Nevertheless,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.480
thank you so much, Mother.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.480
Having Butler Francois around

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.280
really helped us.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.300
When we return home
without Butler Francois,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.360
it'll be really quiet.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.280
It's gonna be fine, baby.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.400
I'll take care of you.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.840
How about this?

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.680
You can take Francois in forever!

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.960
Gosh!

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.800
That's enough, Dear Mother!

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280
Come on,

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.480
let's toast.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.200
Here,

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.400
cheers.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.560
Cheers!

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.970
With Butler Francois gone,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.680
the house is pretty quiet.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.040
It's quite peaceful.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.560
It's better this way.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.010
I'll finally get to sleep on my own.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.080
Oh!

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.080
Hi there, Master!

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.800
Master,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.280
the boy in the photo

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.320
is named Apo Yue.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.600
I want you to look into him;

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.320
I'm curious about what he's really like

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.260
and what tricks he has up his sleeve.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.240
This is strange.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.440
I cannot feel any energy from him.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.240
What does that mean, Master?

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.120
That means you need
to bring Apo to me, in the flesh!

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.830
Po,
[Torphong]

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.370
I just heard
you were in a car accident.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.380
Are you dead-dead?

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.420
I'm going back to Thailand.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.370
Hang in there! Don't die yet!

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.720
Who is this guy?

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:12.690
Hitting Apo up now
after all the time he was hospitalized?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.100
[Torphong: Po, I just heard
you were in a car accident.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.430
Are you dead-dead?
I'm going back to Thailand.

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.750
Hang in there! Don't die yet!]

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:27.370
[Apo: Don't bother me with
any messages, or I'll block your ass]

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400
That should do it.

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:34.430
Tai?

00:34:36.135 --> 00:34:37.335
Tai who?

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:43.550
Hello?

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:45.180
Hello, Po.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.210
How have you been?

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.930
My flight to Thailand is next week.
I'll come to you first thing.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.320
Hello?

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.140
Hey, are you okay?

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.690
Why are you so quiet?

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.080
Hello? You there?

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.200
The hell's wrong with you?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.160
I'm not dead.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.620
Uh...

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.620
don't interrupt my bedtime!

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.580
Why does this Tai guy
sound so familiar?

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.620
I can spend the night here if you want.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.500
Is it better this way?

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.900
Don't you...

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.080
have work in the morning?

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.260
This is also an important job for me.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.380
Thank you...

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.300
for keeping me company.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.220
Likewise,

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.360
thank you for being by my side.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.320
Without you,

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.050
I wouldn't have known how to fix it.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.020
You're exaggerating...

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.260
Your silly Excellency.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.340
Does this rain

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.380
remind you of that day?

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.540
It does.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.980
That day, I...

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.820
actually won the jackpot.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.620
Too bad...

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.500
I died for nothing.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.580
You didn't.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.300
You're here with me, aren't you?

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.860
Mr. Groom-to-be,

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.100
your groom-to-be
is done with the fitting.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.440
Can you breathe in that?

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.300
Uh...

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.080
I can.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.540
You can?

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.060
Then, why are you making that face?

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.660
But this attire
is what Mr. Apo ordered months ago.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.140
What about now?

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.100
Do you still like it?

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.980
I don't know. I...

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.740
I don't think this is me,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.500
but...

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.140
if I changed it now,
Father and Mother would be...

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.340
Forget them.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.420
This ceremony is about us.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.920
I want you to wear
what you feel good in.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.340
Besides,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.700
we're gonna break up anyway,

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.300
so don't stress it.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.780
Could I take a look at what you have?

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.700
Of course.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.700
Here you go.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:47.530
This one is gorgeous.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.140
You do that.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.620
I'll take this call.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.170
Ma'am, could you help me take this off?

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.940
Thank you.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.220
I'm taking off, Phopthorn.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.460
This is...

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.660
my crush from the other world!

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.140
Tai!
