there will be an eclipse.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.270
Call the clinic's front desk
if you need help.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.110
[Is this a convenient time for a call?]
[Call the clinic's front desk
if you need help.]

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.710
[Are you asleep?]
[Sir, please don't contact me
so early in the morning.]

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.760
Are you asleep?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.640
Sir, please don't contact me
so early in the morning.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:21.910
[The moon is so beautiful.]
[Did you drink?]

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.870
The moon is so beautiful.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.380
Did you drink?

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.690
[Sorry.]

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.210
Sorry.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.620
Sir, please stop contacting me
for private matters.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.820
[Sir, please stop contacting me
for private matters.]

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:32.830
Okay. I hope your clinic gets good business.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.930
[Okay. I hope your clinic
gets good business.]
[Good luck to you too.^^]

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.550
[Okay. I hope your clinic
gets good business.]

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.950
Good luck to you, too.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.930
[Good luck to you, too.^^]

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.850
Yes.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.070
Come in.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.970
I don't have time to play with you.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.960
I need to see a doctor, too.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.760
What do you mean?
This is a plastic surgery clinic.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.730
I can't help but be curious,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.510
and I can't help missing you.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.480
And right here,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.860
it feels like
it's been struck by lightning—

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.260
it's a tingling feeling.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.100
Are you really sick?

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.810
You were there on the mountain,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.780
and you were at my house, too.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.700
Hey. You've come to the wrong place.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.390
I've confirmed it—our relationship.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.960
Can you just come out here like that?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.850
That kid just opened the gate of hell.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.240
Don't worry.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.970
I've done what it takes
to repel small ghosts from him.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.050
Yeah, well...

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.000
You'll take care of it.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.590
At first, I hated it.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.650
I wondered why such a person existed.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.800
Is he really an Earthling like me?

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.570
I didn't understand.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.220
My master...

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.580
So why would you pick up trash like that?

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.980
Why are you doing things
no one asked you to?

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.040
Who are you to care about me?

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.650
You should keep this for yourself.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.700
You're really...

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.150
sensitive, irritable,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.280
and picky.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.970
I keep thinking of you.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.150
What are you looking at?

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.970
Thank you for today.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.110
I know.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.320
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.220
You little...

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.430
Move!

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.750
Are you okay?

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.760
It's safe around here at night.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.460
Just letting you know.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.660
Do you...

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.100
like...

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.950
I like you, from the bottom of my heart.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.840
You must really like them.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.160
What? I was just reading from the script.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.180
That wasn't it.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.780
You were thinking about someone,
weren't you?

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.820
Thank you for your performance,
Ha Keumbok.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.270
Thank you.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.220
I miss him? What the hell.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.100
Found it.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.870
Love is like eating.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.570
You need to give
what the other person likes.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.670
What if you can't?

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.350
Then just give a little

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.030
and take it back.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.360
Give a little,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.540
and take it back. Just like this.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.050
It's like playing hard to get.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.540
I'm a master.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.850
I'm just waiting for my love to show up.
Where are they?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.060
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.490
-Actors wait here—
-No.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.490
He's about this tall and has a small face.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.920
Anyway, I'm looking for a guy
called Ha Keumbok.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.610
I'm not sure.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.280
Ha Keumbok!

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.590
You're late.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.010
You...

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.440
It's fun.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.550
If you misuse your power now,

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.760
you might never come back alive.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.440
Are you going to keep making me
conscious of you?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.540
Excuse me.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.250
Can I hold onto you?

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.650
It's night, after all.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.960
Are you okay?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.970
But...

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.280
you came to save me.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.120
Give me your hand.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.600
Again?

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.800
Do you want
to go to the gate of hell then?

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.090
Give me your hand.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.080
You're a genius.
