[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 12]

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.100
Master,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.740
are you serious?

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.800
Kill them!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.800
End it once and for all.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.820
We won't even own up!

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.130
As you command.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.100
So, are you two

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.740
Su Changhe,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.180
the current Patriarch of Blood River,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.340
and Su Muyu, the head of the Su family?

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.620
This is interesting.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.770
I know about you two.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.180
So, the current Blood River

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.090
is led by two Nameless, huh?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.620
How did you guys manage to achieve that?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.650
This has nothing to do

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.420
with our trip here.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.620
You actually utter such preposterous words

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.140
at Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.650
I can see why

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.140
you were a former Kui.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.900
Kui

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.370
is a monster among men.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.370
We travel on the same path.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.060
So, you're the owner of Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.210
Please don't say something like that.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.460
I am

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530
but an accountant.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.810
I'm not the owner

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.740
of the shop.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.420
You guys can view all the items you want.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.300
But please don't land me in trouble.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.690
We dare not do so.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.420
Your words are too heavy, shopkeeper.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.860
Let's not waste any time, then.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.690
Take us to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.180
the treasures of Blood River.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.690
It's been so long

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.590
since anyone

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.740
has visited that place.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.860
Follow me.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.100
This is the place.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.010
The Yellow Springs Pawnshop

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.010
serves everyone in the martial world.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.860
All clans have their treasures deposited in this place.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.130
This is

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.570
the treasury of Blood River.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.890
I have a question.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.620
Even if we don't have this key,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.540
we can get in easily by scaling the wall.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.180
You think you can get in by scaling the wall?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.570
Trust me.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.620
There's no way you can leave in one piece

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.660
even if you're the Patriarch.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.220
The Blood River's Spider's Nest...

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.330
So, you know about that?

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.330
It's nothing compared to the security here.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.220
It's utterly inferior.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.370
When you unlock the gate

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.780
with this key,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.810
all the traps and arrays

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.860
will be dispelled.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.980
Here.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.180
Keep the key.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.740
After this, you'll understand

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.450
how precious

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.690
this key is.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.450
All right.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.010
Is this Blood River's treasury?

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.570
Let me show you the unrefined treasures first.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.250
How many people do they have to assassinate

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.420
for them to gather this amount of wealth?

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.490
Do the gold bricks here

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.100
look a lot to you?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.250
Can you try to understand

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.130
the sufferings of the world for once?

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.100
Even if I combine the chest of silver taels

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.980
and the residence I own,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.130
it's not even worth as much as this chest.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:12.860
To think that this room

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.660
is filled to the brim with such gold bricks.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.540
I understand now.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.420
Blood River has stored all of their wealth

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.890
in this treasury.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.660
If you think that's the only thing they stored here,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.680
Master Su, you're underestimating

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.100
your Blood River predecessors.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.300
Follow me.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.300
Calm down.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.860
There's no one inside.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.780
But I feel sword qi inside.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.930
This sword

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.810
is from the Sword Heart Tomb.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.220
Follow me.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.370
The Sword Heart Tomb,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.890
the Villa of Famed Swords,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.370
and the No-Sword City, which had been eradicated,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.490
most of the famed swords stored here

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.250
all came from those three places.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.690
Look over there.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.180
The armors,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.810
the long sabers,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.890
and the bows and crossbows,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.330
they were also created by

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.810
the famous Lu Clan of Shanbei.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.330
Now, look at the Overlord Armor.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.500
The world thought

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.140
that the Mu family had the only one of its kind.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.690
In reality, Blood River

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.730
has the exact same set.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.570
This room

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.060
is more valuable than the gold room.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.900
If you view it from a monetary perspective,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.660
naturally, this room

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.210
isn't as valuable as the room filled with gold bricks.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.210
However, most of the weapons

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.730
couldn't even be bought with money.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.730
Any one of them

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.210
is rare enough

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.140
that the martial world will kill

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.970
just to get their hands on them.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.930
Shopkeeper Wang,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.210
why are you feeling proud about it?

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.450
All of them belonged

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.210
to our organization, you know?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.850
Ah.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.090
I suppose I was too used to it.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.180
Let's check out the remaining rooms.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.570
After this,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.540
you guys have to practice caution.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.140
[Cosmic Duality]

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.620
[Drums and Thunder Gate]

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.420
I once joined Lei Qianting of the Lei Clan

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.210
to fend off

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.060
Ye Dingzhi's Killing Array.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.450
He once mentioned

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.380
these names to me before.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.930
All of these are

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.930
the strongest gunpowder in the Lei Clan.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.420
I never expected Blood River

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.730
to possess

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.900
the gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.730
This room is filled with all of them

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.730
except for Kirin Fire Tooth,

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.810
which is

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.450
a top-tier gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.570
Therefore, you have to be extra careful

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.300
when unlocking this gate.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.730
Its walls

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.300
and the gate itself

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.850
were forged with Liuhe Steel.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.660
If not,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.730
if the gunpowder inside

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.210
ignites at the same time by accident,

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.730
the entire pawnshop

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.900
will be levelled.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.140
You have to be careful

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.500
when unlocking the next gate as well.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.300
If you're careless,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.690
the three of us

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.330
will be buried here.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.450
That room

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.930
is filled with all sorts of mystical poison.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.060
The Slumbering Serpent King

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.970
can also be found within.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.810
It was reared with the deadly poison

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.570
used by families such as the Wen family

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.850
and the Tang Clan.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.900
Right now, this serpent

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.900
is filled with deadly poison

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.730
that has no cure.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.900
A single drop of its blood

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.540
could easily topple the strongest of

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.660
Heaven-level martial artists

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.970
who had 30 years of cultivation.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.260
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.380
the last room

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.810
should contain all sorts of hidden weapons.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.210
You're very smart.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.380
If we take them to Blood River,

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.970
Blood River can turn into a full army anytime.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.570
It'll be the strongest army in the world.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.610
No one will be able to stop us.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.570
Monsters will be slain.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.780
Even deities

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.690
will be slain.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.540
No wonder this sword

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.500
could cause such a huge commotion.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.610
However, this is a pawnshop.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.730
It's not a money house.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.180
Smart boy.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.930
Plenty of people

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.730
would've leapt out of joy

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.570
upon seeing

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.970
all the treasures here.

Since it's a pawnshop,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.380
that means

in order to obtain all these treasures.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.780
What's the price we have to pay?

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.690
There's no price for you two to pay.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.180
At least

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.500
my pawnshop doesn't need anything from you two

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.570
at the moment.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.540
I don't trust you.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.610
No need to be distrustful.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.850
Actually, you guys had started

you'd completed

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.180

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.450
to possess these treasures.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.140
After all,

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.420

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.540

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.420

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.970

I said that we should've eliminated both of you.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.090
However, I also said

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.260

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.210
Judging from the final result,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.420
perhaps eliminating them back then

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.540
[Heaven Official, Soul Reapers' Hall]
was the best choice.

You cultivated it in secret long ago.

You guys'd better hurry

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.690

let me finish our conversation.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.570
The key you're holding

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.260
can only

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.450
unlock the rooms.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.090
You need another token

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.420
if you wish to retrieve the treasures inside.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.140
What token?

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.900
It's this.

That's the token.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.090
You may unlock

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.210

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.810
And, you may retrieve the treasures inside

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.090
with the token.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.090
Both are essential if you wish to retrieve the treasures.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.090
No wonder the Three Officials of Soul Reapers' Hall

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.380
could always

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.500
command the Three Families around.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.090
I know what you're thinking.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.730
You're thinking

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.730
that you should kill us

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.660
and steal the token

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.300
while the Yellow Springs Pawnshop

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.450
can't react in time.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.450
Or,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.780
you would kill us

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.900
and Shopkeeper Wang.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.210

aren't just for show, you know?

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.690
I just need to press a button,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.180
and the treasures of Blood River

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.050
will be reduced to ashes.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.300
All of your efforts will go down the drain.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.730
Everyone,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.140
please consider this

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.730
carefully.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.540
Three Officials,

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.500
could it be that you all

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.380
have acknowledged me and Su Muyu

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.420
as the leaders of Blood River?

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.900
What do you think?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.780
You guys neglected one thing.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.810
What is it?

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.020
We do not acknowledge the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.730
And, we will stop acknowledging

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.570
the existence of the Three Officials.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.810
You guys won't be included

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.730
in the new Blood River.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.700
It seems we thought too highly of ourselves.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.330
However, don't you guys think

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.260
that

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.740
you're oversimplifying things here?

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:13.980
This is an invitation.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.220

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.700
Is this a wedding banquet invitation?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.260
You guys said you wanted an answer

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.740
and you wish to form a new Blood River.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.850
If so,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.610
you guys need to see

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.570
the man stated in the invitation.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.130
What we wish to form

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.220
has nothing to do with other people.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.460
So naive.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.460
As long as that individual in Tianqi City wishes so,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.260
he can

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.940
obliterate all of the treasures here

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.330
with just one thought of his.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.810

Who's that individual?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.890
The ancestors of said person

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.780

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.500
As for the rest,

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.460
you guys will find out

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.090

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.540

even if we didn't do anything.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.260
If so, let's follow their will

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.060
and head to Tianqi City.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.260

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.810
This is a game of chess.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.220
If we use all of our pieces from the start,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:53.940
we'll lose the upper hand.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.300
You do have a point.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.170
They think that we'll follow their will blindly.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.940
They're underestimating us.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.410

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.130
Father, please buy it for me.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.020
No.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.020
Father, buy it for me.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.090
Fine.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.540
I'll buy it for you.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.700
Mister,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.370
why don't you take a look?

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.020
Father.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.700
Tianqi City is so lively.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.890
[Chongzhen Gate]
It's much more livelier than No-Sword City.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.570
Tianqi City is the first among the Four Great Cities.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.300
It's bustling with life and prosperity.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.650
Naturally, our city

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.460
cannot compare to it.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:06.500
So, where are we

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.410
heading today?

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.850
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau is located at the east.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.060
The astrologists there could pluck the stars with their hands

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.940
and tell one's fortune.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.640
I'll take you there

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.090
to request a Peach Wood Sword that can ward off evil.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.260
There's an academy to the west.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.700
The number one of the world lives there.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.500
I'll take you there to pay him a visit.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.410
Perhaps you can

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.060
be his student when the opportunity arises.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.540
Number one?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.700
Father,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.460
I thought you were the number one swordsman in the world.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.330
I may be at the top

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.890
of ordinary affairs,

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.500
but those who are well-versed in academics

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.740
are the best of the best.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.260
Father, you're the best.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.460
- Let's go. - Father, you're the best.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.700
Father, you're great.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.650
Sir,

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.130
Su Muyu visited the Thousand-Gold Tower and the academy

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.940
after leaving Diaolou Cottage.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.700
However, he didn't enter the academy.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.020
Right now, he's heading toward the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.330
There's no need to wait any longer.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.890
Find him.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.650
Bring him to the Shadow Sect.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.540
Yes, sir.

How dare a filthy member of Blood River

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.500
come to cause trouble here?

[Invitation]

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.330
An invitation, huh?

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.260
Is it an invitation to enter? An invitation to leave?

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.300
Or...

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.090
Chancellor, please give me a hint.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.330
It seems I'm not welcome here.

Mister, what do you need?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.780
Give me a luxury room,

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.500
and a table full of dishes and liquor.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.850
I'm hosting a guest.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.780
All right.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.650
Please head upstairs.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.850
The weather is dry!

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.370
Beware of fire!

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.980
It's very late now.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.890
You've finally arrived.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.020
This is an invitation.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.020
Is this a wedding banquet invitation?

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.020
You've only been here for a day,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.540
yet all of the important figures

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.300
of Tianqi City

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.570
knew about your arrival.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:18.610
They knew

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.610
I was coming.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.410
That's why they don't think it's strange

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.740
no matter who comes to find me tonight.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.850
To them,

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.610
you're merely

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.980
one of those who wanted to know

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.740
why I came to Tianqi City.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.370
You're very smart.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.300
To us,

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.310
if you show yourself,

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.850
we'll be the first to locate you,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.780
for it is us who watch over

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.180
the darkness of Tianqi City.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.810
I heard that the swordsmanship of Master Su

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.810
was unparalleled.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.220
I practice swordsmanship as well.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.650
I wish to see

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.940
your true abilities.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.020
Not everyone has the right

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.540
to test my swordsmanship.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.540
At the very least,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.260
you need to wield your sword

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.090
in front of me.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.610
So, this is the true capability

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.810
of the legendary Umbrella Ghost.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.980

Hawkeye.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.850
The one who watches over Blood River from the dark

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.170
is the Shadow Sect.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.020

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.460
Many people passed by the inn,

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.460
yet none of them came upstairs.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.410
It seems the name of Blood River's Umbrella Ghost

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.390
still intimidates them.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.980
However, I think it's reasonable for the Shadow Sect

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.130
to seek me out.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.220
After all, you guys watch over

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.610

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.780
You said you were acting under the sect leader's command.

Is it Yi Bo, the leader of the Shadow Sect?

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.850
I dare not address

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.700
the sect leader's full name.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.810
He's the master of Luo Qingyang.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.780
I know who he is.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.570
The name of Senior Brother Luo

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.420
is already a taboo

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.570
in the sect.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.370
Up next is...

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.460
That's all for tonight.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.260
What do you mean by this?

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.780
Tonight, I merely wish to find out

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.940
about your identity.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.300
As for the rest,

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.260
we can talk about them tomorrow.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.700
The Shadow Sect, huh?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.130
It seems I need to owe them a favor.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.260
This is already the 13th batch

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.980
of assailants.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.410
Someone is trying to impede us

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.460
from entering Tianqi.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.810
It's Blood River.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.300
I received new intel.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.060
Su Muyu

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.170
has already entered Tianqi alone.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.500
I think he has a goal to achieve

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.370
before our arrival.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.170
I told you guys long ago.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.940
We shouldn't underestimate Blood River.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.980
I've engaged Su Changhe and Su Muyu

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.610
in battle before.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.020
They are outstanding young individuals.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.300
If it's possible,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.260
I hope

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.260
that they can become our companions.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.570
Water Official,

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.020
what do you mean by that?

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.090
Tianqi City's Shadow Sect

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.090
had already fallen from grace.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.540
But the current Blood River

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.890
is filled with hope, don't you agree?

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:18.940
Such foolishness.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.850
Blood River is merely a killing tool

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.410
meant for other people to wield.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.130
Enough.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.740
We should make haste.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.020
From now on,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.890
do not utter such preposterous words

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.130
again.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.370
They didn't want to be the Umbrella Ghost

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.500
and the Undertaker.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.130
They merely want to be themselves.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.410
Actually, I'm the same.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.330
I only wish to be Su Henshui,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.980
not the Water Official.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.850
Whose letter is this?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.260
It's from your favorite Su Muyu.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.020
He wants me to complete a request.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.780
You guys said you would arrive on the second day.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.060
I've been waiting for a few days.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.500
You guys were the one who decided on that date.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.170
We will come anytime

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.850
we like.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.700

to a banquet that will be held in three days.

Attend it in secret.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.260
Do not let anyone find out.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:11.980
Sir,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.740
why did you bring me here?

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.090
Are we here

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.260
to retrieve the treasures in Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.260
I'm bringing you to see someone.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.370
Who is it?

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.020
The Ferryman.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.410
Mister, you've returned.

Hongying,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.090
you ferry people every day.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.850
How much is Yellow Springs Pawnshop paying you?

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.460
Mister,

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.650
to think that you still remember my name.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.850
I ferry people here every day

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.850
without charging a single cent.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.980
I'm merely waiting for my destined one to come.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.460
If so, can the guy beside me

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.260
be your destined one, then?

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.020
I...

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.300
Sir,

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.130
are you going to sell me off?

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.700
Mister, do you know

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.220
what I meant when I uttered the phrase

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.940
"destined one"?

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.850
Your name is Hongying.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.410
The surname Hong is very rare.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.460
Is that your surname?

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.300
I do not have

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.300
a surname.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.500
From today onward, you shall have one.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.370
Your surname will be Mu.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.020
He's the head of the Mu family.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.220
That's what I meant by saying that he's your destined one.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.170
Patriarch of Blood River,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.570
are you trying to steal one of my men?

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.610
You can pick and choose

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.770
any items in the room

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.980
that will amount to the same value as her.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.220
But now,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.500
Hongying is mine.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.300
The token they gave you

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:48.220
was a fake.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.170
The Shadow Sect

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:50.940
has the real deal.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.060
If so, I will owe you for now.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.980
You may choose your items

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.940
once I retrieve the token.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.780
It's a deal.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:05.740
Miss,

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.130
from today onward,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.060
you're a member of the Mu family.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.820
[Zhe]

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.220
It turns out that the enemy of Shadow Sect

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.850
is Xiao Ruofeng, the Prince of Langya.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.090
The Four Guardians of Tianqi City and the Inner Security Division,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.220
which were founded by him,

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.810
robbed Shadow Sect of their power.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.460
Therefore, they gave

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.890
the Three Officials an order.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.090
They instructed the Patriarch

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.300
to deal with Second Master Tang

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.260
to lure Tang Lianyue

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.260
out of Tianqi City.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.610
After that, they used us

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.890
to get rid of Tang Lianyue,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.060
eliminating a powerful foe of theirs in the process.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.090
This muddy affair in Tianqi City

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.940
is much more troublesome than I thought.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.370
Given your identity,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.170
you had to slip away from that place day after day.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.370
Aren't you afraid that the Prince of Langya

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.220
might find out about you?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.850
Many people knew

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.570
that I wasn't willing to remain at the imperial mausoleum.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.330
If I kept watch

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.700
over the mausoleum

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.060
without doing anything,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.290
I assume

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.690
[Zhuo Qing, Former Great Eunuch]
they need to be worried about that.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.020
Speaking of which,

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:16.420
Sect Leader,

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.290
how's that pledge of loyalty

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.900
coming lately?

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.730
Just tell First Prince

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.770
to enjoy the show.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.980
I will use Blood River

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.460
to eliminate

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.060
our common foe.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.820
Excellent.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:36.380
It's good that you're confident.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.060
When will we meet the Umbrella Ghost?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.090
He will attend the banquet

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.940
in three days.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:49.420
If so, the sword qi that's approaching us,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.690
who does it belong to?

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.610
He has an immense sword qi,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.460
yet his killing intent is well-hidden.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.170
A ferocious sword

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.610
that will devour its wielder

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.130
if he doesn't keep it in check...

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:11.250
Su Muyu!

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.290
How dare you?

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.500
So, you are Su Muyu.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.090
Excellent.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.570
We were supposed to meet in three days.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.290
But you're here today.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.690
Why is that the case?

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.340
The goal of this trip

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.210
wasn't to let Shadow Sect seek out Blood River.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.460
It's the opposite.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.570
You wish to meet me in three days.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:38.900
However, I wish to meet you

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.540
today.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.090
You're quite different from the tales

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.610
I've heard about you.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:46.940
Care to explain yourself?

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.770
Rumor has it that Su Muyu

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.130
resembled a swordsman

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:52.980
more than an assassin.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.980
He had a gentle personality,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.500
and he treated everyone with respect.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.500
But when you came,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.020
you drew your sword.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.210
When you spoke,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.210
you wanted to rob the host of his power.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.210
Now, there are no longer any assassins left in Blood River.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:09.900
As the head of the Su family,

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.170
I have to adopt a stronger attitude.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.250
However, Sect Leader Yi, this is your residence after all.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.020
I'm a guest.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.610
It's indeed rude of me

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.130
to show up unannounced.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.290
If you don't welcome me,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.570
I can leave right now.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.210
In three days,

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.250
you would've been able to enjoy

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.610
the Jiantian Feast prepared by Zhaiyue Restaurant.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.170
What a shame.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.020
Since

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.020
you're already here,

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.730
I have to host you somehow.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:39.610
Crow.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.380
Yes, sir.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.690
Tell the kitchen

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.770
to prepare some dishes for us.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.900
I need to have a chat

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.610
with Master Su.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.020
Thank you.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.170
Come.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:56.610
Mr. Su,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.290
please.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.170
Mr. Su, I'm sure you're still perplexed.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.770
Blood River and Shadow Sect

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.610
weren't related from the start.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.020
However,

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.420
now, it seems

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.210
we're bound by countless invisible threads.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.340
Soul Reapers' Hall

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.210
was the one that assigned all missions to Blood River.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.780
We always thought

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.030
that someone in the martial world put a huge bounty on their targets

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.170
and hired Soul Reapers' Hall to put a hit on them.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.420
I never expected Shadow Sect to be the one assigning our missions to us.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.900
Speaking of that,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.980
we need to trace back to the time

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.900
when Beili had first established its own state.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.130
This is

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.420
a long stretch of history.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.340
[Yi's Residence]

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.170
However, Su Changhe and I, who lead

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.460
the current Blood River,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.860
have nothing to do

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.380
with the Shadow Guards that existed centuries ago.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.570
I know.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.060
You guys are Nameless.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.340
You two aren't connected

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.420
to the lineage of Blood River.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.540
You're wrong.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.690
The current Blood River

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.380
is a true family.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.980
And, we will choose our own paths.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.170
You guys are too young.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.770
It seems you guys don't know anything.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.210
For example,

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.860
Wanjuan Tower.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.340
Wanjuan Tower?

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.250
That's right.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.020
Wanjuan Tower.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.540
For the past few centuries,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.570
Blood River was under Shadow Sect.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.090
The address of Blood River,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.210
which ordinary people could never locate,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.020
Spider's Nests that were spread throughout

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.940
the world,

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.250
your true identities,

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.980
the martial arts you use, your weaknesses,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.650
and your portraits

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.500
were all kept within the Shadow Sect.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.820
If you attempt to betray us,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:00.570
all this information

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.020
will surface in the martial world.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.060
You all are assassins who've slain countless people.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.340
When we look around,

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.780
the martial world

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.420
is filled with your sworn enemies.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.540
By that time,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.500
all of you

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.980
will be hunted down.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.170
I know.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.340
You guys will surely think

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.690
that the current Shadow Sect

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.290
only has an empty reputation

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.730
of an organization led by the emperor's father-in-law.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.420
You think that we had fallen from grace

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.770
in Tianqi City.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.420
You think that we're even inferior to Blood River.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.090
What gives us the right

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.130
to be the master of Blood River?

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:48.570
However,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.020
as long as I'm willing,

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.860
I can eradicate Blood River.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.900
You guys wish to establish a new Blood River

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.060
and start from scratch.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.420
You see,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.500
it's good for youngsters to have lofty aspirations.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.460
But sometimes,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.900
they should stop

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.340
and assess their abilities first.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.200
Do you guys truly think

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.690
that you can resist the years of control

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:22.770
of the Shadow Sect

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.940
with the likes of you?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.340
Tell me your condition.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.940
I allowed you guys to come to Tianqi City

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.690
because I needed you all to kill someone for me.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.900
Who is it?

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.460
The Prince of Langya,

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.060
Xiao Ruofeng.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.500
Blood River is the shadow that handles the martial world

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.090
on the Xiao imperial line's behalf.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.770
The Shadow Sect

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.570
is the shadow that protects Tianqi City

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.900
in the dark.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.980
If so, what happens in Tianqi City

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.130
should be unrelated to Blood River.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.940
The Prince of Langya is a member of the Xiao imperial line.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.540
Assassinating him

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.170
would mean going against the beliefs of both organizations.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.090
This isn't the duty of Shadow Sect.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.540
You're just doing this for your own desire.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.130
Since that's the case,

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.940
you must offer something in exchange.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.570
What do you

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.770
desire?

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.020
Everything you said just now

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.690
must vanish

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.940
from the world entirely.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.090
From now on, Blood River

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:49.860
and Shadow Sect will be unrelated.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.690
It seems

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.900
that's the end of our negotiation.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.610
Crow,

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.170
see our guest off.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.460
Sir, you know the best

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.130
about the task

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.690
you wish to assign to us.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.250
The Prince of Langya has the most military strength in Beili.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:37.610
Even the emperor

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.170
has to show him respect in the imperial court.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.650
In the martial world,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.420
he's known as the senior brother of Baili Dongjun,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.980
the lord of Xueyue City.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.610
If I kill him,

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.980
I'll offend the entire world.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.900
I don't think

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.900
you have the right to negotiate a deal with me.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.380
If word of Blood River spreads

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.730
across the jianghu,

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.340
then we, with nowhere to go,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.540
will make Tianqi City

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.980
our first stop.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.540
Maybe the world won't have us,

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.060
but we'll...

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.980
erase the Shadow Sect from this world.
