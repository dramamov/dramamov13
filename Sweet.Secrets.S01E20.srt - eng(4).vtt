=Episode 20=
(The Bride of Wujian)

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.119
I knew you'd come to accuse me.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.760
It was I who used all my spiritual power
to repair the soul-eating sword.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.639
But when I did that,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.199
it wasn't meant to target Miss Lu.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.559
I only wanted you to stay alive.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320
You're the supreme priest of Wujian,

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.400
dedicated to preserving Wujian's peace.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.599
It's your duty.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.039
I don't blame you.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.719
Now that the sword is in my hand,

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:01.719
none of you can hurt her.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.400
Do you love her that much?

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.360
Yes.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.519
Till death, unwavering.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.719
Perhaps now,
things have taken a new turn.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.159
Your spiritual powers are now merging.

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:25.480
This means that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.960
Lu Huayan is no longer
the vessel of the Mei pearl.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.440
So what does that mean?

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.119
It means that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.440
the Mei pearl has already
recognised Lu Huayan as its master.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.400
Even if you refuse
to take the Mei pearl,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.800
I still have a way

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.719
to let both of you live.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.320
That's great.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Then I'll entrust

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.159
all of this to you.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.039
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.039
You and Lu Huayan
can never both survive.

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.519
Everything I've done

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.800
was for Wujian.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.719
Darling, why are you
staring at me like that?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.320
Because my husband looks so handsome,

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.920
it's hard to resist.

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.920
Then I'll just

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.760
give in to my darling's temptation.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.920
You still have to go to work.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.159
From today on,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.599
you must stay by my side at all times.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.039
Put on your hat.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.159
Let's go.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.719
I haven't put on my coat yet.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.920
I heard our commander's wife
is very pretty.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.800
Of course she is.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.840
Let me introduce everyone.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.960
This is my wife.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.239
- Hello, madam.
- Hello, madam.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Hello, everyone.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.719
Please sit.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.159
Sit down.

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.440
How's the investigation

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:48.639
into capturing Jing Haisi?

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.519
According to your order,

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.360
we've already raided the Jing residence.

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:52.559
But the place was empty.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.320
Jing Haisi has clearly fled.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.719
We've tightened control
across the whole city.

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.920
Good work.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.639
My wife is thirsty.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.440
Pour her some tea.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.440
Try it.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.519
Please have some tea, madam.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.519
Continue.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.440
I'll take charge
of the citywide search for Jing Haisi.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.079
We've blocked off the docks first.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.800
And the train station.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.239
He hasn't left Ye City.

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.519
But it's as if he's vanished
from the mortal realm.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.159
Expand the search area.

00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:24.119
Yes, sir.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.800
My wife's chair isn't comfortable.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.599
Bring in a sofa.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:31.679
No need.

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.400
I'm comfortable sitting here.

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:39.360
Then let's continue.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.719
We also investigated
Jing Haisi's social connections.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.000
We found he only had business partners.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960
He didn't socialize much with others.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.920
Good work, everyone.

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:49.599
From today onward,

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.880
strictly guard my wife's safety.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.360
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:56.119
Are you satisfied, darling?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.719
I'm more than satisfied.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.559
Meeting adjourned.

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.599
What about me?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.390
You too, leave.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.400
Alright.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.760
Why are you two still here?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.840
Yes, sir.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:21.920
Darling.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.599
From today on,

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:24.880
you must stay with me

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:26.119
every minute of every day,

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.119
never apart.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:28.840
Alright.

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.360
I want to take you somewhere.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.760
That long meeting is finally over.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.159
At last, I have time with my wife

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.119
to talk about ourselves.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.599
If your human subordinates

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.119
knew their commander was lovestruck,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.920
they'd probably laugh at you.

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.400
Laugh?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.000
I think they'd be jealous
of the love between my wife and me.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.800
Mr. Li,

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:10.760
don't flatter yourself.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.880
But

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.239
why did you bring me here today?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.239
Yan,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.599
I once lost all our memories.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.039
I thought
that after these hundreds of years,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.400
I could live alone like this,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.559
enjoying a life with no one beside me,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.840
no one to talk to.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.519
But each time I woke
from a dream at midnight,

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.119
I felt a piece of my heart missing.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.760
Until the Mei pearl guided me

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.760
to find you.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.760
Mr. Li,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.559
how much more do you have to say to me?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.320
The Mei pearl awakened all my memories,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.559
and the love buried for centuries.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.239
I remember everything now.

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:30.920
Even though you remember nothing,

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:34.119
I'm already content.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.920
I just want to stay by your side,

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.159
close to you.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.159
When you're happy,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.239
I'll laugh with you.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.760
When you're sad, I'll wipe your tears.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.360
When it rains,
I'll hold an umbrella for you.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.599
The two of us

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:59.559
can just sit quietly like this,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.559
watching the sun rise and set.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.559
A cup of wine,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.960
a pot of tea,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.159
perfect.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.559
Yan,

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:17.439
I must thank you
for letting go of your hatred,

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:19.520
and seeing Wujian anew.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.640
Mr. Li,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.760
have you had designs on me all along?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.359
To win my willing heart,

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.560
and my lifelong devotion?

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.720
That's right.

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:50.159
Lu Huayan,

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.640
will you be my

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.800
one and only bride,

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:56.279
destined for me through

00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:58.000
all lifetimes?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.560
I am willing.
